ABSTRACT 
The ability to obtain three-dimensional structure from visual motion is 
important for survival of human and non-human primates. Using a parallel process- 
ing model, the current work explores how the biological visual system might solve 
this problem and how the neurophysiologist might go about understanding the 
solution. 
INTRODUCTION 
Psychophysical experiments have shown that monkey and man are equally 
adept at obtaining three dimensional structure from motionL In the present work, 
much effort has been expended mimicking the visual system. This was done for one 
main reason: the model was designed to help direct physiological experiments in the 
primate. It was hoped that if an approach for understanding the model could be 
developed, the approach could then be directed at the primate's visual system. 
Early in this century, von Helmholtz 2 described the problem of extracting 
three-dimensional structure from motion: 
Suppose, for instance, that a person is standing still in a thick woods, 
where it is impossible for him to distinguish, except vaguely and roughly, 
in the mass of foliage and branches all around him what belongs to one 
tree and what to another, or how far apart the separate trees are, etc. But 
the moment he begins to move forward, everything disentangles itself, 
and immediately he gets an apperception of the material content of the 
woods and their relation to each other in space, just as if he were looking 
at a good stereoscopic view of it. 
If the object moves, rather than the observer, the perception of three- 
dimensional structure from motion is still obtained. Object-centered structure from 
motion is examined in this report. Lesion studies in monkey have demonstrated that 
two extra-striate visual cortices called the middle temporal area (abbreviated MT

or V5) and the roedial superior temporal area (MST) 3,4 are involved in obtaining 
structure from motion. The present model is meant to mimic the V5oMST part of 
the cortical circuitry involved in obtaining structure from motion. The model 
attempts to determine if the visualimage corresponds to a three-dimensional object. 
THE STRUCTURE FROM MOTION STIMULUS 
The problem that the model solved was the same as that posed in the studies 
of monkey and man 1. Structured and unstructured motion displays of a hollow, 
orthographically projected cylinder were computed (Figure 1). The cylinder rotates 
about its vertical axis. The unstructured stimulus was generated by shuffling the 
velocity vectors randomly on the display screen. The overall velocity and spatial 
distribution for the two displays are identical; only the spatial relationships have 
been changed in the unstructured stimulus. Human subjects report that the points 
are moving on the surface of a hollow cylinder whenviewing the structured stimulus. 
With the unstructured stimulus, most subjects report that they have no sense of 
three-dimensional structure.

FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE MODEL 
Aswith the primate subjects, the modelwas required to only indicate whether 
or not the display was structured. Subjects were not required to describe the shape, 
velocity or size of the cylinder. Thus the output cell* of the model signaled "1" if

neuron or group of neurons. The term neuron refers only to the actual wetware 
in the brain.

structured and "0" if not structured. This output layer corresponds to the cortical 
area MST of macaque monkey which appear to be sensitive to the global organiza- 
tion of the motion image 5. It is not known if MST neurons will distinguish between 
structured and unstructured images. 
The input t.o the model was based on physiological studies in the macaclue 
monkey. Neurons in area V5 have a retinotopic representation of visual space 6,7.

layer cell. The optimal velocity is "Vo". 
For each retinotopic location there is 
an encoding of awide range of veloci- 
ties 8. Thus in the model's input rep- 
resentation, there were cells that 
represent different combinations of 
velocity and retinotopic spatial posi- 
tion. Furthermore motion velocity 
neurons in V5 have a center-sur- 
round opponent organization 9. The 
width of the receptive fields was 
taken from the data of Albright et 
al. 8. A typical receptive field of the 
model is shown in Figure 2. 
It was possible to determine what the activity of the input cells would be for 
the rotating cylinder given this representation. The activation pattern of the set of 
input cells was computed by convolving the velocity points with the difference of 
gaussians. The activity of the 100 input cells for an image of 20 points, with an an- 
gular velocity of 8ø/sec is presented in Figure 3.

lus. The circles correspond to the cells of the input layer. The contours were com- 
704 
puted using a linear interpolation between the individual cells. The horizontal axis 
corresponds to the position along the horizontal meridian. The vertical axis corre- 
sponds to the speed along the horizontal meridian. Thus activation of a cell in the 
upper right hand coruer of the graph correspond to a velocity of 30ø/sec towards the 
right at a location of 3 ø to the right along the horizontal meridian. 
Inspection of this input pattern suggested that the problem of detecting 
three-dimensional structure from motion may be reduced to a pattern recognition 
task. The problem was then: "Given a sparsely sampled input motion flow field, de- 
termine whether it corresponds best to a structured or unstructured object." 
Itwas next necessary to determine the connections between the two input and 
output layers such that the model will be able to correctly signal structure or no struc- 
ture (1 or 0) over a wide range of cylinder radii and rotational velocities. A parallel 
distributed network of the type used by Rosenberg and Sejnowski 10 provided the 
functional architecture (Figure 4).

Figure 4. The parallel architecture used to extract structure 
from motion. The input layer (I), corresponding to area V5, 
mapped the position and speed along the horizontal axis. 
The output layer (O) corresponded to area MST that, it is 
proposed, signals structure or not. The middle layer (M) 
may exist in either V5 or MST. 
The input layer of cells was fully connected to the middle layer of cells. The 
middle layer of cells represented an intermediate stage of processing and may be in 
either V5 or MST. All of the cells of the middle layer were then fully connected to 
the output cell. The inputs from cells of the lower layer to the next higher level were 
summed linearly and then "thresholded" using the Hill equation X3/(X 3 + 0.53). 
The weights between the layers were initially chosen between +1. The values of the 
weights were then adjusted using back-propagation methods (steepest descent) so 
that the network would "learn" to correctly predict the structure of the input image. 
The model learned to correctly perform the task after about 10,000 iterations 
(Figure 5).

The iteration number is plotted against the 
mean square error. The error is defined as the 
difference between the model's prediction and 
the known structure. The model was trained on 
a set of structured and unstructured cylinders 
with a wide range of radii, number of points, 
0 and rotational velocities.

PSYCHOPHYSICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL 
The model's performance was comparable to that of monkey and man with 
respect to fraction of structure and number of points in the display (Figure 6). The 
model was indeed performing a global analysis as shown by allowing the model to 
view only a portion of the image. Like man and monkey, the moders performance 
suffers. Thus it appears that the moders performance was quite similar to known 
monkey and human psychophysics.

fraction of structure. As the fraction of structure increase, the moders performance 
improves. Thirty repetitions were averaged for each value of structure for the model. 
The fraction of structure is defined as (1-Rs/Rc), where R s is the radius of shuffling 
of the motion vectors and R c is the radius of the cylinder. The human and monkey 
data are taken from psychophysical studies 1. 
HOW IS IT DONE? 
The model has similar performance to monkey and man. It was next possible 
to examine this artificial network in order to obtain hints for studying the biological 
system. Following the approach of an electrophysiologist, receptive field maps for 
all the cells of the middle and output layers were made by activating individual input 
cells. The receptive field of some middle layer cells are shown in Figure 7. The layout 
of these maps are quite similar to that of Figure 4. However, now the activity of one 
cell in the middle layer is plotted as a function of the location and speed of a motion 
stimulus in the input layer. One could imagine that an electrode was placed in one 
of the cells of the middle layer while the experimentalist moved a bar about the 
706 
horizontal meridian with different locations and speeds. The activity of the cell is 
then plotted as a function of position and space.

as a contour map as a function of horizontal position and speed. Dotted lines

These middle layer receptive field maps were interesting because they 
appear to be quite simple and symmetrical. In some, the inhibitory central regions 
of the receptive field were surrounded by excitatory regions (Figure 7A). Comple- 
mentary cells were also found. In others, there are inhibitory bands adjacent to 
excitatory bands (Figure 7B). The above results suggest that neurons involved in 
extracting structure from motion may have relatively simple receptive fields in the 
spatial velocity domain. These receptive fields might be thought of as breaking the 
image down into component parts (i.e. a basis set). Correct recombination of these 
second order cells could then be used to detect the presence of a three-dimensional 
structure. 
The output cell also had a simple receptive field again with interesting 
symmetries (Figure 8). However, the receptive field analysis is insufficient to 
indicate the role of the cell. Therefore in order to properly understand the "mean- 
ing" of the cell's receptive field, it is necessary to use 
stimuli that are "real world relevant"- in this case the 
structure from motion stimuli. The output cell would 
give its maximal response only when a cylinder stimulus 
is presented.

Nothing about this receptive field structure indicates the 
cell is involved in obtaining structure from motion.

This work predicts that neurons in cortex involved in extracting structure 
from motion will have relatively simple receptive fields. In order to test this 
hypothesis, it will be necessary to make careful maps of these cells using small 
patches of motion (Figure 9). Known qualitative results in areas V5 and MST are 
consistent with, but do not prove, this hypothesis. As well, it will be necessary to use 
"relevant" stimuli (e.g. three-dimensional objects). If such simple receptive fields 
are indeed used in structure from motion, then support will be found for the idea that 
a simple cortical circuit (e.g. center-surround) can be used for many different visual 
analyses.

maps of these neurons using small patches of 
motion, in order to observe the postulated simple 
receptive field properties of cortical neurons involved in extracting structure from 
motion. Such structures may not be apparent using hand moved bar stimuli. 
DISCUSSION 
In conclusion, it is possible to extract the three-dimensional structure of a 
rotating cylinder using a parallel network based on a similar functional architecture 
as found in primate cortex. The present model has similar psychophysics to monkey 
and man. The receptive field structures that underlie the present model are simple 
when viewed using a spatial-velocity representation. It is suggested that in order to 
understand how the visual system extracts structure from motion, quantitative 
spatial-velocity maps of cortical neurons involved need to be made. One also needs 
to use stimuli derived from the "real world" in order to understand how they may 
be used in visual field analysis. There are similarities between the shapes of the 
receptive fields involved in analyzing structure from motion and receptive fields in 
striate cortex 11. It maybe that similar cortical mechanisms and connections are used 
to perform different functions in different cortical areas. Lastly, this model demon- 
strates that the use of parallel architectures that are closely modeled on the cortical 
representation is a computationally efficient means to solve problems in vision. Thus 
as a final caveat, I would like to advise the creators of networks that solve 
ethologically realistic problems to use solutions that evolution has provided.
