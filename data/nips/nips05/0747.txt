Abstract 
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be applied to several impor- 
tant problems in molecular biology. We introduce a new convergent 
learning algorithm for HMMs that, unlike the classical Baum-Welch 
algorithm is smooth and can be applied on-line or in batch mode, 
with or without the usual Viterbi most likely path approximation. 
Left-right HMMs with insertion and deletion states are then trained 
to represent several protein families including immunoglobulins and 
kinases. In all cases, the models derived capture all the important 
statistical properties of the families and can be used efficiently in 
a number of important tasks such as multiple alignment, motif de- 
tection, and classification.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Hidden Markov Models (e.g., Rabiner, 1989) and the more general EM algorithm in 
statistics can be applied to the modeling and analysis of biological primary sequence 
information (Churchill (1989), Lawrence and Reilly (1990), Baldi et al. (1992), 
Cardon and Stormo (1992), Hz. ussler et al. (1992)). Most notably, as in speech 
recognition applications, a family of evolutionarily related sequences can be viewed 
as consisting of different utterances of the same prototypical sequence resulting from 
a common underlying HMM dynamics. A model trained from a family can then be 
used for a number of tasks including multiple alignments and classification. The 
multiple alignment is particularly important since it reveals the highly conserved 
regions of the molecules with functional and structural significance even in the 
absence of any tertiary information. The multiple alignment is also an essential 
tool for proper phylogenetic tree reconstruction and other important tasks. Good 
algorithms based on dynamic programming exist for the alignment of two sequences. 
However they scale exponentially with the number of sequences and the general 
multiple alignment problem is known to be NP-complete. Here, we briefly present 
a new algorithm and its variations for learning in HMMs and the results of some of 
the applications of this approach to new protein families. 
2 HMMs FOR BIOLOGICAL PRIMARY SEQUENCES 
A HMM is characterized by a set of states, an alphabet of symbols, a probability 
transition matrix T = (tij) and a probability emission matrix eij. As in speech 
applications, we are going to consider left-right architectures: once a given state is 
left it can never be visited again. Common knowledge of evolutionary mechanisms 
suggests the choice of three types of states (in addition to the start and to the 
end state): the main states rnl, ..., rnv, the delete states dl, ..., dv+ and the insert 
states i, ..., iN+. N is the length of the model which is usually chosen equal to the 
average length of the sequences in the family and, if needed, can be adjusted in later 
stages. The details of a typical architecture are given in Figure 1. The alphabet 
has 4 letters in the case of DNA or RNA sequences, one symbol per nucleotide, 
and 20 letters in the case of proteins, one symbol per amino acid. Only the main 
and insert states emit letters, while the delete states are of course mute. The 
linear sequence of state transitions start - rn - m2 - ... - mN - end is the 
backbone of the model and correponds to the path associated with the prototypical 
sequence in the family under consideration. Insertions and deletions are defined 
with respect to this backbone. Insertions and deletions are treated symmetrically 
except for the loops on the insert states needed to account for multiple insertions. 
The adjustable parameters of the HMM provide a natural way of incorporating 
variable gap penalties. A number of other architectures are also possible. 
3 LEARNING ALGORITHMS 
Learning from examples in HMMs is typically accomplished using the Baum-Welch 
algorithm. In the Baum-Welch algorithm, the expected number nij (resp. mij) 
of i - j transitions (resp. emissions of letter j from state i) induced by the data 
are calculated using the forward-backward procedure. The transition and emission

probabilities are then reset to the observed frequencies by

ni mi 
where ni -- -]j nij and mi - -]j mij. It is clear that this algorithm can lead to 
abrupt jumps in parameter space and that the procedure cannot be used for on- 
line learning (after each training example). This is even more so if, in order to 
save some computations, the Viterbi approximation is used to estimate likelihoods 
and transition and emission statistics by computing only the most likely paths as 
opposed to the forward-bacward procedure where all possible paths are examined. 
A new algorithm for HMM learning which is smooth and can be used on-line or in 
batch mode, with or without the Viterbi approximation, can be defined as follows. 
For each

(resp. eij) we define a new parameter wij (resp. vii) by 
½wij 
tij = -]./ eWk and 
(2) 
Normalisation constraints are naturally enforced by this representation throughout 
learning with the added advantage that none of the parameters can reach the ab- 
sorbing value 0. After computing on-line or in batch mode the statistics nij and 
mij using the forward-backward procedure (or the usual Viterbi approximation), 
the update equations are particularly simple and given by 
Awij -- ](nij _ tij) and Avij -- ](mij eij) (3) 
ni mi 
where / is the learning rate. In Baldi et al. (1992) a proof is given that this 
algorithm must converge to a maximum of the product of the likelihoods of the 
training sequences. In the case of an on-line Viterbi approximation, the optimal 
path associated with the current training sequence is first computed. The update 
equations are then given by 
Awij ---- rl(tj -- tij) and Avij -- rl(tj -eij) (4) 
750 Baldi, Chauvin, Hunkapiller, and McClure 
Here, for a fixed state i, ti and tiej are the target transition and emission val- 
ues' ft.. - I every time the transition si -* s i is part of the Viterbi path of the 
corresponding training sequence sequence and 0 otherwise and similarly for tie/. 
After training, the model derived can be used for a number of tasks. First, by 
computing for each sequence its most likely path through the model using the 
Viterbi algorithm, multiple sequences can be aligned to each other in time O(KN2), 
linear in the number K of sequences. The model can also be used for classification 
and data base searches. The likelihood of any sequence (randomly generated or 
taken from any data base) can be calc'lated and compared to the likelihood of the 
sequences in the family being modeled. Additional applications are discussed in 
Baldi et al. (1992). 
4 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
The previous approach has been applied to a number of protein families including 
globins, immunoglobulins, kinases, aspartic acid proteases and G-coupled receptor 
proteins. The first application and alignment of the globin family using HMMs 
(trained with the Viterbi approximation of the Baum-Welch algorithm, and a num- 
ber of additional heuristics) was given by Haussler et al. (1992). Here, we briefly 
describe some of our results on the immunoglobulin and the kinase families  
4.1 IMMUNOGLOBULINS 
Immunoglobulins or antibodies are proteins produced by B cells that bind with 
specificity to foreign antigens in order to neutralize them or target their destruction 
by other effector cells (e.g., Hunkapiller  Hood, 1989). The set of sequences used in 
our experiments consists of immunoglobulins V region sequences from the Protein 
Identification Resources (PIR) data base. It corresponds to 294 sequences, with 
minimum length 90, average length 117 and maximum length 254. The variation in 
length resulted from including any sequence with a V region, including those that 
also included signal or leader sequences, germline sequences that did not include the 
J segment, and some that contained the C region as well. Seventy seqences contained 
one or more special characters indicating an ambiguous amino acid determination 
and were removed. 
For the immunoglobulins variable V regions, we have trained a model of length 117 
using a random subset of 150 sequences. Figure 2 displays the alignment corre- 
sponding to the first 20 sequences in this random subset. Letters emitted from the 
main states are upper case and letters emitted from insertion states are lower case. 
Dashes represent deletions or accomodate for insertions. As can be observed, the 
algorithm has been able to detect all the main regions of highly conserved residues. 
Most importantly, the cysteine residues towards the beginning and the end respon- 
sible for the disulphide bonds which holds the chains together are perfectly aligned 
and marked. The only exception is the fifth sequence from the bottom which has 
a serine residue in its terminal portion. It is also important to remark that some 
 Recently, Hausssler et al. have also independently applied their approach to the kinase 
family (Haussler, private communication).

of the sequences in the family have some sort of "header" (leader signal peptide) 
whereas the others do not. We did not remove the headers prior to training and 
used the sequences as they were given to us. The model was able to detect and 
accomodate these "headers" by treating them as initial inserts as can be seen from 
the alignment of two of the sequences. 
4.2 KINASES 
Eukaryotic protein knases co-.stitute a very large family of proteins that regu- 
late the most basic of cellular processes through phosphorylation. They have been 
termed the "transistors" of the cell (Hunter (1987)). We have used the sequences 
available in the kinase data base maintained at the Salk Institute. Our basic set 
consists of 224 sequences, with minimum length 156, average length 287, and max- 
imal length 569. Only one sequence containing a special symbol (X) was discarded. 
In one experiment, we trained a model of length 287 using a random subset of 
150 kinase sequences. Figure 3 displays the corresponding alignment for a subset 
of 12 phylogenetically representative sequences. These include serine/threonine, 
tyrosine and dual specificity kinases from mammals, birds, fungi and retroviruses 
and herpes viruses. The percentage of identical residues within the kinase data 
sets ranges from 8-30%, suggesting that only those residues involved in catalysis 
are conserved among these highly divergent sequences. All the 12 characteristic 
catalytic domains or subdomains described in Hanks and Quinn (1991) are easily 
recognizable and marked. Additional highly conserved positions can also be ob- 
served consistent with previously constructed multiple alignments. For instance, 
the initial hydrophobic consensus Gly-X-Gly-XX-Gly together with the Lys located 
15 or 20 residues downstream are part of the ATP/GTP binding site. The carboxyl 
terminus is characterized by the presence of an invariant Arg residue. Conserved 
residues in proximity to the acceptor amino acid are found in the VIb (Asp), VII 
(Asp-Phe-Gly) and VIII domains (Ala-Pro-Glu). In Figure 4, the entropy of the 
emission distribution of each main state is plotted: motifs are easily detectable and 
correspond to positions with very low entropy. 
DISCUSSION 
HMMs are emerging as a powerful, adaptive, and modular tool for computational 
biology. Here, they have been used, together with a new learning algorithm, to 
model families of proteins. In all cases, the models derived capture all the important 
statistical properties of the families. Additional results and potential applications, 
such as phylogenetic tree reconstruction, classification, and superfamily modeling, 
are discussed in Baldi et al. (1992).
