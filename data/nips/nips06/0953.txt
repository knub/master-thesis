Abstract 
We propose a computational model for how the cortex discriminates 
shape and depth from texture. The model consists of four stages: (1) 
extraction of local spatial frequency, (2) frequency characterization, (3) 
detection of texture compression by normalization, and (4) integration 
of the normalized frequency over space. The model accounts for a 
number of psychophysical observations including experiments based on 
novel random textures. These textures are generated from white noise 
and manipulated in Fourier domain in order to produce specific 
frequency spectra. Simulations with a range of stimuli, including real 
images, show qualitative and quantitative agreement with human 
perception. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
There are several physical cues to shape and depth which arise from changes in projection 
as a surface curves away from view, or recedes in perspective. One major cue is the 
orderly change in the spatial frequency distribution of texture along the surface. In 
machine vision approaches, various techniques such as Fourier transformation or wavelet 
decomposition are used to determine spatial frequency spectra across a surface. The 
determination of the transformation relating these spectra is a difficult problem, and 
several techniques have been proposed such as an affine transformation (Super and Bovik 
953 
954 Sakai and Finkel 
1992) or a momentum method (Krumm and Shafer 1992). We address the question of 
how a biological system which has access only to limited spatial frequency information 
and has constrained computational capabilities can nonetheless accurately determine 
shape and depth from texture. For example, the visual system might avoid the direct 
comparison of frequency spectra themselves and instead rely on a simpler 
characterization of the spectra such as the mean frequency, peak frequency, or the 
gradient of a frequency component (Sakai and Finkel 1993; Turner, Gerstein, Bajcsy 
1991). In order to study what frequency information is actually utilized by humans, we 
created novel random texture patterns and carried out psychophysical experiments with 
these stimuli. These patterns are generated by manipulating the frequency components of 
white noise stimuli in the Fourier domain so as to produce stimuli with exactly specified 
frequency spectra. Based on these experiments, we propose a network mechanism for the 
perception of shape-from-texture which takes into account physiological and anatomical 
constraints as well as computational considerations. 
2 MODEL FOR SHAPE FROM TEXTURE 
The model consists of four major processes: extraction of the local spatial frequency at 
each orientation, frequency characterization, determination of texture compression by 
frequency normalization, and the integration of the normalized frequency over space. A 
schematic illustration of the model is shown in figure 1. Our psychophysical experiments 
suggest that the visual system may use spatially averaged peak frequency for 
characterizing the frequency distribution. The change of surface orientation is 
determined from the locally aligned compression of texture which is detected by 
frequency normalization followed by lateral inhibition among different orientations. 
Depth is then computed from the integration of the normalized frequency over space. 
The model is implemented in feed-forward distributed networks and simulated using the 
NEXUS neural network simulator (Sajda, Sakai, Yen and Finkel 1993). 
3 MOTIVATION FOR EACH STAGE OF THE MODEL 
The frequency extraction is carried out by units modeling complex cells in area V1. 
These units have subunits with On and Off center difference of Gaussian(DOG) masks 
tuned to specific frequencies and orientations. The units take local maximum of the 
subunits. As in energy-based models (Bergen and Adelson 1989; Malik and Perona 
1990), these units accomplish some major aspects of complex cell functions in the space 
domain including invariance to the direction of contrast and spatial phase. 
The second stage of the model extracts spatially averaged peak frequency. In order to 
examine what frequency information is actually utilized by humans, we created random 
texture patterns with specific frequency spectra generated by manipulating the frequency 
components of a white noise pattern in Fourier domain. Figure 2 shows a vertical 
cylinder and a tilted perspective plane constructed by this technique from white noise. 
We are able to see the three dimensional shape of the cylinder in (1). The stimuli were 
constructed by making each frequency component undergo a step change at some

Figure 1. A schematic illustration of the shape-from-texture model consisting of four 
major stages. The early vision stage models major spatial properties of complex cells in 
order to decompose local spatial frequency. The second stage characterizes the 
frequency by the spatially averaged peak frequency. The third stage detects locally 
aligned texture compression by normalizing frequency and taking lateral inhibition 
among orientation channels. The last stage determines 3D depth by integrating the 
amount of texture compression - which corresponds to the local surface slant. Indices "f" 
and "o" denote frequency and orientation channels, respectively. max, min, ave, and LI 
stand for taking maximum, minimum, average, and lateral inhibition. The vertical bar 
indicates that the function is processed independently within each of denoted channels.

position along the cylinder; higher frequencies undergo the change at positions closer to 
the cylinder's edges. Since the gradient of each frequency component is always either 
zero or infinity, this suggests that gradients of individual frequency components over 
space do not serve as a dominant cue for three dimensional shape perception. Similar 
experiments have been conducted using various stimuli with controlled frequency 
spectra. The results of these experiments suggest that averaged peak frequency is a 
strong cue for the human perception of three dimensional shape and depth. 
The third stage of the model normalizes local frequencies by the global lowest frequency 
on the surface. We assume that the region containing the global lowest frequency is the 
frontal plane standing vertically with respect to the viewer. One of the justifications for 
this assumption can be seen in simple artificial images shown in figure 3. In both (1) and 
(2), the bottom region looks vertical to us, and the planes above this region looks slanted, 
although the patterns of the center region of (1) and the lower region of (2) are identical. 
From a computational point of view, the normalization of frequency corresponds to an 
approximation of the relation between local slant and spatial frequency. Depth, Z, as a 
function of X (see figure 4) is given by: 
Z(x) = tan{ cos4(Fø ) }dx= ( ))2- I dx eq.(l) 
F(x) 
where Fo is the global lowest frequency. Considering a boundary condition, Z(x) = 0, if 
F(x) = Fo, the integrand can be reasonably approximated by (F(x) - F0) ! F 0 . The second 
stage of the model actually computes this value, and a later stage carries out the 
integration.

The second half of this stage detects the local alignment of texture compression. This 
local alignment is detected by taking the lateral inhibition of normalized frequencies 
among different orientations. Recent psychophysical experiments (Todd and Akerstrom 
1987; Cumming, Johnson, and Parker 1993) show that the compression of texture in a 
single orientation is a cue for the perception of shape-from-texture. We can confirm this 
result from figure 5. Three images on the top of this figure have compression in a single 
orientation, but those on the bottom do not. We clearly see smooth three dimensional 
ellipsoids from the top images but not from the bottom images. 
The last stage of the model computes the integral of the normalized frequency in order to 
obtain depth. This integration begins from the region with lowest spatial frequency and 
follows the path of the local steepest descent in spatial frequency.

bottom regions look vertical to us, and the planes above this region look slanted, although 
the patterns of the center region of (1) and the lower region of (2) are identical.

4 SIMULATIONS 
A quantitative test of the model was carried out by constructing ellipsoids with different 
eccentricities and texture patterns shown in figure 5. Results are plotted in figure 6. For 
the regular ellipsoids, there is a linear relation between real depth and that determined by 
the model. This linear relation agrees with psychophysical experiments (Todd and 
Akerstrom 1987; Btilthoff 1991) showing similar human performance for such stimuli. 
All of the irregular texture patterns produced little perception of depth, in agreement with 
human performance. 
Many artificial and real images have been tested with the model and show good 
agreement with human perception. For an example, a real image of a part of cantaloupe, 
and its computed depth are shown in figure 7. Real images were obtained with a CCD 
camera and were input to NEXUS via an Imaging Technology's S 151 image processor.

5 CONCLUSIONS 
(1) We propose a biologically-based network model of shape-from-texture based on the 
determination of change in spatial frequency. 
(2) Preliminary psychophysical evidence suggests that the spatially averaged peak 
frequency is employed to characterize the spatial frequency distribution rather than using 
a frequency spectrum or each component of frequency.

(3) This characterization is validated by psychophysical experiments using novel random 
textures with specified frequency spectra. The patterns are generated from white noise 
and manipulated in Fourier domain in order to realize specific frequency characteristics. 
(4) The model has been tested with a number of artificial stimuli and real images taken 
by video camera. Responses show qualitative and quantitative agreements with human 
perception.
