Abstract 
Maps of orientation preference and ocular dominance were recorded 
optically from the cortices of 5 infant macaque monkeys, ranging in 
age from 3.5 to 14 weeks. In agreement with previous observations, 
we found that basic features of orientation and ocular dominance 
maps, as well as correlations between them, are present and robust 
by 3.5 weeks of age. We did observe changes in the strength of 
ocular dominance signals, as well as in the spacing of ocular dom- 
inance bands, both of which increased steadily between 3.5 and 14 
weeks of age. The latter finding suggests that the adult spacing 
of ocular dominance bands depends on cortical growth in neonatal 
animals. Since we found no corresponding increase in the spacing 
of orientation preferences, however, there is a possibility that the 
orientation preferences of some cells change as the cort;.cal surface 
expands. Since correlations between the patterns of orientation 
selectivity and ocular dominance are present at an age, when the 
visual system is still immature, it seems more likely that their de- 
velopment may be an innate process and may not require extensive 
visual experience.

I INTRODUCTION 
Over the past years, high-resolution images of the simultaneous representation of 
orientation selectivity and ocular dominance have been obtained in large areas of 
macaque striate cortex using optical techniques [3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18]. These studies 
confirmed that ocular dominance and orientation preference are organized in large 
parts in slabs. While optical recordings of ocular dominance are in accordance with 
previous findings, it turned out that iso-orientation slabs are much shorter than 
expected, and that the orientation map contains several other important elements 
of organization - singularities, fractures, and saddle-points. 
A comparison between maps of orientation preference and ocular dominance, which 
were derived from the same region of adult monkey striate cortex, showed a pro- 
nounced relationship between both patterns [5, 12, 13, 15, 17]. Fourier analyses, 
for example, reveal that orientation preferences repeat at closer intervals along the 
ocular dominance slabs than they do across them. Singularities were found to align 
with the centers of ocular dominance bands, and the iso-orientation bands, which 
connect them, intersect the borders of ocular dominance bands preferably at angles 
close to 90 ø . 
Given the fact that these relationships between the maps of orientation and ocular 
dominance are present in all maps recorded from adult macaques, one naturally won- 
ders how this organization matures. If the ocular dominance slabs were to emerge 
initially, for example, the narrower slabs of iso-orientation might later develop in 
between. This might seem likely given the anatomical segregation which is apparent 
for ocular dominance but not for orientation [9]. However, this possibility is contra- 
dicted by physiological studies that show normal, adult-like sequences of orientation 
preference in the early postnatal weeks in macaque when ocular dominance slabs 
are still immature [19]. The latter findings suggest a different developmental hy- 
pothesis; that the organization into regions of different orientation preferences may 
precede or even guide ocular dominance formation. A third possibility, consistent 
with both previous results, is that orientation and ocular dominance maps form 
independently and align in later stages of development. 
In order to provide evidence for one or the other hypothesis, we investigated the 
relationship between ocular dominance and orientation preference in very young 
macaque monkeys. Results are presented in the remainder of this paper. Section 2 
contains an overview about the experimental data, and section 3 relates the data 
to previous modelling efforts.

singularities, and fractures (Fig. lc). The ocular dominance map shows its typical 
pattern of alternating bands. 
Figure 23 shows the result of a complex 2D Fourier transform of the orientation 
map shown in Figure la. Like for maps recorded from adult monkeys [13] the 
spectrum is characterized by a slightly elliptical band of modes which is centered 
at the origin. The major axis approximately aligns with the axis parallel to the 
border to area 18 as well as with the ocular dominance bands. Therefore, like in 
the adults, the orientation map is stretched perpendicular to the ocular dominance 
bands, apparently to adjust to the wider spacing. 
When one neglects the slight anisotropy of the Fourier spectra one can estimate a 
power spectrum by averaging the squared Fourier amplitudes for similar frequen- 
cies. The result is a pronounced peak whose location is given by the characteristic 
frequency of the orientation map (Fig. 2b). As a consequence, autocorrelation func- 
tions have a Mexican-hat shape (Fig. 2c), much like it has been reported for adults 
[13, 15]. 
In summary, the basic features of the patterns of orientation and ocular dominance 
are established as early as 3.5 weeks of age. Data which were recorded from four

CHARACTERISTIC WAVELENGTHS AND SIGNAL 
STRENGTH 
A more detailled analysis of the recorded patterns, however, reveals changes of 
certain features with age. Table 1 shows the changes in the typical wavelength of 
the orientation and ocular dominance patterns as well as the (normalized) ocular 
dominance signal strength with age. The strength of the ocular dominance signal 
increases by a factor of 1.5 between 3.5 weeks and adulthood, a fact, which could 
be explained by the still ongoing segregation of fibers within layer IVc. 
The spacing of the ocular dominance columns increases by approximately 30% be- 
tween 3.5 weeks and adulthood. This change in spacing would be consistent with 
the growth of cortical surface area during this period [16] if one assumes that cor- 
tex grows anisotropically in the direction perpendicular to the ocular dominance 
bands. Interestingly, the characteristic wavelengths of the orientation patterns do 
not exhibit such an increase. The wavelengths for the patterns recorded from the 
different infants are close to the "adult" values. More evidence for a stable orienta- 
tion pattern is provided by the fact, that the density ofsingularities is approximately 
constant with age 2 and that the percentage of cortical area covered by linear zones 
does neither increase nor decrease. Hence we are left with the puzzle that at least 
the pattern of orientation does not follow cortical growth.

already apparent that singularities have a strong tendency to align with the center 
of the ocular dominance bands (arrow 1) and that in the linear zones (arrow 2), 
where iso-orientation bands exist, these bands intersect ocular dominance bands at 
angles close to 90 ø most of the time. 
Table 2 shows a quantitative analysis of the local intersection angle. Percentage 
of area covered by linear zones (cf. [12] for details of the calculation) is given for 
regions, where orientation bands intersect ocular dominance bands within 18 ø of 
perpendicular, and regions where they intersect within 18 ø of parallel. For all of 
the animals investigated the percentages are two to four times higher for regions, 
where orientation bands intersect ocular dominance bands at angles close to 90 ø, 
much like it has been observed in adults [12]. In particular there is no consistent 
trend with age: the correlations between the orientation and ocular dominance 
maps are established as early as 3.5 weeks of age.

3 CONCLUSIONS AND RELATION TO MODELLING 
In summary, our results provide evidence that the pattern of orientation is estab- 
lished at a time when the pattern of ocular dominance is still developing. However, 
they provide also evidence for the fact that the pattern of orientation is not linked 
to cortical growth. This latter finding still needs to be firmly established in studies 
where the development of orientation is followed in one and the same animal. But if 
it is taken seriously the consequence would be that orientation preferences may shift 
and that pairs of singularities are formed. The early presence of strong correlations 
between both maps indicate that the development of orientation and ocular dom- 
inance are not independen processes. Both paerns have to adjust to each oher 
while cortex is growing. It, therefore, seems as if the third hypothesis is true (see 
Introduction) which states that both patterns develop independently and adjust to 
each other in the late stages of development. As has been shown in [13, 15] and is 
suggested in [7, 14] these processes are certainly in the realm of models based on 
Hebbian learning. 
Many features of the orientation and ocular dominance maps are present at an age 
when the visual system of the monkey is still immature [8, 11]. In particular, they 
are present at a time when spatial vision is strongly impared. Consequently, it 
seems unlikely that the development of these features as well as of the correlations 
between both patterns requires high acuity form vision, and models which try to 
predict the structure of these maps from the structure of visual images [1, 2, 10] 
have to take this fact into account. The early development of orientation prefer- 
ence and its correlations with ocular dominance make it also seem more likely that 
their development may me an innate process and may not require extensive visual 
experience. Further experiments, however, are needed to settle these questions.
