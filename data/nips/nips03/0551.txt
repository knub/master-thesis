INTRODUCTION 
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to recognize a 
long/short pattern for a particular commodity future con- 
tract. The Back-Propagation of errors algorithm was used to 
encode the relationship between the Long/Short desired out- 
put and 18 fundamental variables plus 6 (or 18) technical 
variables into the ANN. 
2 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE 
The ANNs used were simple, feed forward, single hidden layer 
networks with no input units, N hidden units and one output 
unit. See Figure 1. N varied from six (6) through sixteen 
(16} hidden units.

3 TRAINING PROCEDURE 
Back Propagation of Errors Algorithm- The ANN was trained 
using the well known ANN training algorithm called Back 
Propagation of Errors which will not be elaborated on here. 
A Few Hods to the Algorithm' We are using the algorithm 
above with three changes. The changes, when implemented and 
tested on the standard

exclusive-or problem, resulted in a 
network after 60-70 passes through 
This compares to the 245 passes 
Even with a 32 hidden unit network, 
Yves found the average number of passes to be 120 [2].

4 DATA 
In all cases, the six market technical variables (Open, 
High, Low, Close, Open Interest and Volume) were that trad- 
ing day's data for the "front month" commodity contract 
{roughly speaking, the most active month's commodity con- 
tract). 
The first set of training data consisted of 105 or 143 
"high confidence" trading days in 1988. Each trading day 
had associated with it a twenty-five component pattern vec- 
tor (25-vector) consisting of eighteen fundamental varia- 
bles, such as weather indicators and seasonal indicators, 
plus the six market technical variables for the trading day, 
and finally, the EXPERT's hindsight long/short position. 
The test data for these networks was all 253 25-vectors in 
1988. 
The next training data set consisted of all 253 trading days 
in 1988. Again each trading day had associated with it a 
25-vector consisting of the same eighteen fundamental varia- 
bles plus the six market technical variables and finally, 
the EXPERT's long/short position. The test set for these 
networks consisted of 25-vectors from the first 205 trading 
days in 1989. 
Finally, the last set of training data consisted of the last 
251 trading days in 1988. For this set each trading day had 
associated with it a 37 component pattern vector (37-vector) 
consisting of the same eighteen fundamental variables plus 
six market technical variables for that trading day, six 
market technical variables for the previous trading day, six 
market technical variables for the two days previous trading 
day, and finally, the EXPERT's long/short position. The 
test set for these networks consisted of 37-vectors from the 
first 205 trading days in 1989.

Figure 4 is the profit plot for the network when tested on 
the first 205 trading days in 1989. Two significant fea- 
tures should be noted in Figure 4. The network's profit 
step function is almost always increasing. The profit is 
never negative.
