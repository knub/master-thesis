Abstract 
Inspired by a visual motion detection model for the rabbit retina 
and by a computational architecture used for early audition in the 
barn owl, we have designed a chip that employs a correlation model 
to report the one-dimensional field motion of a scene in real time. 
Using subthreshold analog VLSI techniques, we have fabricated and 
successfully tested a 8000 transistor chip using a standard MOSIS 
process. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Most proposed short-range intensity-based motion detection schemes fall into two 
major categories: gradient models and correlation models. In gradient models, 
computation begins from local image qualities such as spatial gradients and tem- 
poral derivatives that can be vulnerable to noise or limited resolution. Correlation 
models, on the other hand, use a filtered version of the input intensity multiplied 
with the temporally delayed and filtered version of the intensity at a neighboring

receptor. Many biological motion detection systems have been shown to use a cor- 
relation model (Grzywacz and Poggio, 1990). To make use of this model, previous 
artificial systems, that typically look at sampled images of a scene changing in time, 
have had to cope with the correspondence problem, i.e. the problem of matching 
features between two images and measuring their shift in position. Whereas tradi- 
tional digital approaches lend themselves to the measurement of image shift over a 
fixed time, an analog approach lends itself to the measurement of time over fixed 
distance. The latter is a local computation that scales to different velocity ranges 
gracefully without suffering from the problems of extended interconnection. 
Inspired by visual motion detection models (Barlow and Levick, 1965) and by a 
computational architecture found in early audition (Konishi, 1986), we have de- 
signed a chip that contains a large array of velocity-tuned "cells" that correlate two 
events in time, using a delay-line structure. We have fabricated and successfully 
tested an analog integrated circuit that can can report, in real time, the field mo- 
tion of a one-dimensional image projected onto the chip. The chip contains 8000 
transistors and a linear photoreceptor array with 28 elements. 
2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
Figure I shows the block diagram of the chip. The input to the chip is a real-world 
image, focused directly onto the silicon via a lens mounted over the chip. The one- 
dimensional array of on-chip hysteretic photoreceptors (Delbrfick and Mead, 1989) 
receives the light and reports rapid changes in the signal for both large and small 
changes. Each photoreceptor is connected to a half-wave rectifying neuron circuit 
(Lazzaro and Mead, 1989) that fires a single pulse of constant voltage amplitude 
and duration when it receives a quickly rising (but not falling) light-intensity signal. 
This rising light intensity signal is interpreted to be a moving edge in the image 
passing over the photoreceptor. It is this signal that is the "feature" to be corre- 
lated. Note that the choice of the rising or falling intensity as a feature, from an 
algorithmic point of view, is arbitrary. Each neuron circuit is in turn connected to 
an axon circuit (Mead, 1989) that propagates the pulse down its length. By off- 
enting the axons in alternating directions, as shown in Figure 1, any two adjacent 
receptors generates pulses that will "race" toward each other and meet at some 
point along the axon. Correlators between the axons detect when pulses pass each 
other, indicating the detection of a specific time difference. The width of the puls- 
es in the axon circuits is adjustable and determines the detectable velocity range. 
From the summing of "votes" for different velocities by correlators across the entire 
chip, a winner-take-all circuit (Lazzaro et al., 1989) determines the velocity.

3. SYSTEM OPERATION AND RESULTS 
3.1 READING BETWEEN THE LINES 
The basic signal quantity that we are measuring is the time a "feature" takes to 
travel from one photoreceptor to one of its neighbors. By placing two delay lines 
in parallel that propagate signals in opposing directions, a temporal difference in 
signal start times from opposite ends will manifest itself as a difference in the 
location where the two signals will meet. Between the axons, correlation units 
perform a logical AND with the axon signals on both sides. If pulses start down 
adjacent axons with zero difference in start times (i.e. infinite velocity), they will 
meet in the center and activate a correlator in the center of the axon. If the time 
difference is small (i.e. the velocity is large), correlations occur near the center. As 
the time difference increases, correlations occur further out toward the edges. The 
two halves of the axon with respect to the center represent different directions of 
motion. When a single stimulus (e.g. a step edge) is passed over the lcngth of the 
photoreceptor array with a constant velocity, a specific subset of correlators will be 
activated that all represent the same velocity. A current summing line is connected 
to each of these correlators and is passed to a winner-take-all circuit. The winner of 
the winner-take-all computation corresponds to the line that is receiving the largest 
number of correlation inputs. The output of the winner-take-all is scanned off the 
chip using an external input clock. Because the frequency of correlation affects the 
confidence of the data, scenes that are denser in edges provide more confident data 
as well as a quicker response. 
3.2 SINGLE VS. BURSTING MODE 
Until now, the circuit dcscribed uses a single pulse to indicate a passing edge. Due to 
the statistical nature of this system, a large number of samples are needed to make 
a confident statement of the detected tinhe difference, or velocity. By externally 
increasing the amplitude of the signal passed to the neuron during each event, the 
neuron can fire multiple pulses in quick succession. With an increased number 
of pulses travelling down the axon, the number of correlations increase, but with 
a decrease in accuracy, due to the multiple incorrect correlations. The incorrect 
correlations are not random, however, but occur closely around the correct velocity. 
The end result is a net decrease in resolution in order to achicve increased confidence 
in the final data. 
3.3 VELOCITY RANGE 
The chip output is the measured time difference of two events in multiples of r, the 
time-constant of a single axon section. The time difference (measured in second- 
s/pixel) is translated into velocity, by the equation V = 1/At, where V is velocity 
in pixels/sec and At can be positive or negative. Thus the linear measurement o1 
time difference gives a non-linear velocity interpretation with the highest resolution 
410 Horiuchi, Lazzaro, Andrew Moore, and Koch 
at the slower speeds. At the slower speeds, however, we tend to have decreased 
confidence in the data due to the relatively smaller correlation frequency. This 
is expected to be less troublesome as larger photoreceptor arrays are used. The 
variable resolution in the computation is often an acceptable feature for control of 
robotic motion systems since high velocity motions are often ballistic or at least 
coarse, whereas fine control is needed at lower velocities. 
3.4 PERFORMANCE 
We have fabricated the circuit shown in Figure i using a double polysilicon 2/m 
process in the MOSIS Tiny Chip die. The chip has 17 velocity channels, and an 
input array of 28 photoreceptors. The voltages from the winner-take-all circuit are 
scanned out sequentially by on-chip scanners, the only clocked circuitry on the chip. 
In testing the chip, gratings of varying spatial frequencies and natural images from 
newspaper photos and advertisements were mounted on a rotating drum in front 
of the lens. Although the most stable data was collected using the gratings, both 
images sources provided satisfactory data. Figure 2 shows oscilloscope traces of 
scanned winner-take-all channels for twelve different negative and positive veloci- 
ties within a specific velocity range setting. The values to the right indicate the 
approximate center of the velocity range. Figure 3(a) shows the winning time in- 
terval channel vs. actual time delay. The response is linear as expected. Figure 
3(b) shows the data from Figure 3(a) converted to the interpreted velocity channel 
vs. velocity. The horizontal bars indicate the range of velocity inside of which each 
channel responds. As described above, at the lower velocities, correlations occur at 
a lower rate, thus some of the lowest velocity channels do not respond. By increas- 
ing the number of parallel photoreceptor channels, it is expected that this situation 
will improve. The circuit, currently with only eight velocity channels per direction, 
is able to reliably measure, over different settings, velocities from 2.9 pixels/see up 
to 50 pixels/sec.

An interesting feature of our model that also manifests itself in the visual system 
of the fly (Buchner 1984) is spatial aliasing, leading in the worst case to motion 
reversal. Spatial aliasing is due to the discrete sampling provided by photoreceptor 
spacing. At spatial frequencies higher than the Nyquist limit, a second stimulus can 
enter the neighboring axon before the first stimulus has exited, causing a sudden 
change in the sign of the velocity. 
4 CONCLUSION 
A correlation-based model for motion detection has been successfully demonstrated 
in subthreshold analog VLSI. The chip has shown the ability to successfully detect 
relatively low velocities; the slowest speed detected was 2.9 pixels/sec. and shows 
promise for use in different settings where other motion detection strategies have 
difficulty. The chip responds very well to low-light stimulus and its output is robust 
against changes in contrast. This is due to the high temporal derivative sensitivity 
of the hysteretic photoreceptor to both large and small changes. Interestingly, the 
statistical nature of the computation allows the system to perform successfully in 
noise as well as to produce a level of confidence measure. In addition, the nature of 
the velocity computation provides the highest resolution at the slower speeds and 
may be considered as an effective way to expand the detectable velocity range.
