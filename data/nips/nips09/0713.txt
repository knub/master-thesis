Abstract 
The major problem that has prevented practical application of analog 
neuro-LSIs has been poor accuracy due to fluctuating analog device 
characteristics inherent in each device as a result of manufacturing. 
This paper proposes a dynamic control architecture that allows analog 
silicon neural networks to compensate for the fluctuating device 
characteristics and adapt to a change in input DC level. We have 
applied this architecture to compensate for input offset voltages of an 
analog CMOS WTA (Winner-Take-All) chip that we have fabricated. 
Experimental data show the effectiveness of the architecture. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Analog VLSI implementation of neural networks, such as silicon retinas and adaptive 
filters, has been the focus of much active research. Since it utilizes physical laws that 
electric devices obey for neural operation, circuit scale can be much smaller than that of a 
digital counterpart and massively parallel implementation is possible. The major problem 
that has prevented practical applications of these LSIs has been fluctuating analog device 
characteristics inherent in each device as a result of manufacturing. Historically, this has 
been the main reason most analog devices have been superseded by digital devices. 
Analog neuro VLSI is expected to conquer this problem by making use of its adaptability. 
This optimistic view comes from the fact that in spite of the unevenness of their 
components, biological neural networks show excellent competence. 
This paper proposes a CMOS circuit architecture that dynamically compensates for 
fluctuating component characteristics and at the same time adapts device state to 
incoming signal levels. There are some engineering techniques available to compensate 
714 K. lizuka, M. Miyamoto and H. Matsui 
for MOS threshold fluctuation, e.g., the chopper comparator, but they need a periodical 
change of mode to achieve the desired effect. This is because there are two modes one for 
the adaptation and one for the signal processing. This is quite inconvenient because extra 
clock signals are needed and a break of signal processing takes place. 
Incoming signals usually consist of a rapidly changing foreground component and a 
slowly varying background component. To process these signals incessantly, biological 
neural networks make use of multiple channels having different temporal/spatial scales. 
While a relatively slow/large channel is used to suppress background floating, a 
faster/smaller channel is devoted to process the foreground signal. The proposed method 
inspired by this biological consideration utilizes different frequency bands for adaptation 
and signal processing (Figure 1), where negative feedback is applied through a low pass 
filter so that the feedback will not affect the foreground signal processing.

As a basic building block to construct neuro-chips, analog WTA circuits have been 
investigated by researchers such as [Lazzaro, 1989] and [Pealtoni, 1994]. All CMOS 
analog WTA circuits are based on voltage follower circuits [Pealtoni, 1995] to realize 
competition through inhibitory interaction, and they use feedback mechanisms to enhance 
resolution gain. The architecture of the chip that we have fabricated is shown in Figure 2 
and the circuit diagram is in Figure 3. This WTA chip indicates the lowest input voltage 
by making the output voltage corresponds to the lowest input voltage near Vss (winner), 
and others nearly the power supply voltage Vdd (loser). The circuit is similar to [Sheu, 
1993], but represents two advances. 
1. The steering current that the feedback controller absorbs from the line CM is 
enlarged, allowing the winner cell can compete with others in the region where 
resolution gain is the largest. 
2 The feedback controller originally placed after the second competitive layer is 
removed in order to guarantee the existence of at least one output node whose voltage 
is nearly zero. 
Table 1 shows the specifications of the fabricated chip.

2.2 INPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE 
Input offset voltages of a WTA chip may greatly deteriorate chip performance. Examples 
of input offset voltage distribution of the fabricated chips are shown in Figure 4. Each 
input offset voltage is measured relative to the first input node. The input offset voltage 
716 K. lizuka, M. Miyamoto and H. Matsui 
AV:. of the j-th input node is defined as AV = Vin i - Vin when the voltages of output 
nodes Out/and Out are equal; Vin is fixed to a certain voltage and the voltage of other 
input nodes are fixed at a relatively high voltage.

Figure 4: Examples of measured input offset voltage distribution. 
The primary factor of the input offset voltage is considered to be fluctuation of MOS 
transistor threshold voltages in the first layer competitive cell. Then, the input offset 
voltage AVe. of this cell yielded by the small fluctuation AVtN of VtN is calculated as 
follows:

gm4(gd + gd 2 + gm2) AVth 4 
= _AVthl + gd + gd 2 + gm: (AVth2 _ AVth3) + , 
gm gmgm 3 
where gm and gdi are the transconductance and the drain conductance of MOS Mi, 
respectively. Using design and process parameters, we can estimate the input offset 
voltage to be 
A Vj ,, -A Vth I + (AVth 2 - AVth 3 ) + 0.15A Vth 4 , 
Based on our experiences, the maximum fluctuation of Vth  in a chip is usually smaller 
than 20 mV, and it is reasonable to consider that the difference IAVth  - AVth31 is even 
smaller; perhaps less than 5 mV, because M2 and M3 compose a current mirror and are 
closely placed. This implies that the maximum of AV:. is about 28 mV, which is in rough 
agreement with the measured data. 
3 DYNAMICAL ADAPTATION ARCHITECTURE 
In Figure 5, we show circuit implementation of the dynamically adaptable WTA function. 
In each feedback channel, the difference between each output and the reference Vref is 
fed back to the input node through a low pass filter consisting of R and C. The charge 
stored in capacitor C is controlled by this feedback signal. 
Let the linear approximation of the WTA chip DC characteristic be 
Vouti = A ( Vini - VO.O, 
where Vin and Vout are the voltages at the nodes In and Out respectively, and A and VO 
are functions of Vinj (j , i ). The input offset voltage relative to the node In is considered 
to be the difference between VO and VO. On the other hand, the DC characteristic of the 
i-th feedback path can be approximated as

It follows from the above two equations that 
AB B 
Vin i =- VOi - Vref.. VO t 
1- AB 1- AB 
The last term is derived using the assumptions A >> I and B << -1. This means that the 
voltage difference between the DC level of the input and VOi is clamped on the capacitor 
C. This in turn implies that the input offset voltage will be successfully compensated for. 
The role of the low pass filters is twofold. 
1. They guarantee stable dynamics of the feedback loop; we can make the cutoff 
frequency of the low pass filters small enough so that the gain of the feedback path is 
attenuated before the phase of the feedback signal is delayed by more than 180 ø . 
2. They prevent the feed-forward WTA operation from being affected, as shown in 
Figure 1, the adaptive control is carried out on a different, non-overlapped frequency 
band than WTA operation. 
4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Experiments concerning the adaptable WTA function were carried out by applying pulses 
of 90% duty to the input nodes In't and In'_,, while other input nodes were fixed to a 
certain voltage. In Figures 6 (a) and 6 (b), the output waveforms of Out, Out2, Out3 and 
the waveform of the pulse applied to the node ln't are shown. Figure 6(a) shows the result 
when the same pulse was applied to both In't and In'. Figure 6(b) shows the result when 
the amplitude of the pulse to In't was greater than that of the pulse to In' by 10 mV. The 
schematic explanation of this behavior is in Figure 7. The outputs remained at the same 
levels for a while after the inputs were shut off, since there was no strong inducement. As 
a result of adaptation, the winning frequencies of every output nodes become equal in a 
long time scale. This explains the unstable output during the period of quiescent inputs.

The chip used in this measurement had a relative input offset voltage of 15 mV between 
nodes In and In 2. We can see in Figure 6 (a) that this offset voltage was completely 
compensated for because the output waveforms of corresponding nodes were the same.

5 CONCLUSION 
We have proposed a dynamic adaptation architecture that uses frequency divided control 
and applied this to a CMOS WTA chip that we have fabricated. Experimental results 
show that the architecture successfully compensated for input offset voltages of the WTA 
Dynamically Adaptable CMOS Winner-Take-All Neural Network 719 
chip due to inherent device characteristic fluctuations. Moreover, this architecture gives 
analog neuro-chips the ability to adapt to incoming signal background levels. This 
adaptability has a lot of applications. For example, in vision chips, the adaptation may be 
used to compensate for the fluctuation of photo sensor characteristics, to adapt the gain of 
photo sensors to background illumination level and to automatically control color balance. 
As another application, Figure 8 describes an analog neuron with weighted synapses, 
where the time constant RC is much larger than the time constant of input signals.

The key to this architecture is use of non-overlapping frequency bands for adaptation to 
background and foreground signal processing. For neuro-VLSIs, this requires 
implementing circuits with completely different time scale constants. In modern VLSI 
technology, however, this is not a difficult problem because processes for very high 
resistances, i.e., teraohms, are available.
