Abstract 
It has been suggested that long-range intrinsic connections in striate cortex may 
play a role in contour extraction (Gilbert et al., 1996). A number of rent 
physiological and psychophysical studies have examined the possible role of 
long range connections in the modulation of contrast detection thresholds (Polat 
and Sagi, 1993,1994; Kapadia et al., 1995; Kovfics and Julesz, 1994) and various 
pre-attentive detection tasks (Kovfics and Julesz, 1993; Field et al., 1993). We 
have developed a network architture based on the anatomical connectivity of 
striate cortex, as well as the temporal dynamics of neuronal processing, that is 
able to reproduce the observed experimental results. The network has been tested 
on real images and has applications in terms of identifying salient contours in 
automatic image processing systems. 
INTRODUCTION 
Vision is an active process, and one of the earliest, preattentive actions in visual 
processing is the identification of the salient contours in a scene. We propose that this 
process depends upon two properties of striate cortex: the pattern of horizontal 
connections between orientation columns, and temporal synchronization of cell responses. 
In particular, we propose that perceptual salience is directly related to the degree of cell 
synchronization. 
We present results of network simulations that account for rent physiological and 
psychophysical "pop-out" experiments, and which successfully extract salient contours 
from real images.

MODEL ARCHITECTURE 
Linear quadrature steerable filter pyramids (Freeman and Adelson, 1991) are used to model 
the response characteristics of cells in primary visual cortex. Steerable filters am 
computationally efficient as they allow the energy at any orientation and spatial frequency 
to be calculated from the responses of a set of basis filters. The fourth derivative of a 
Gaussian and its Hilbert transform were used as the filter kernels to approximate the shape 
of the receptive fields of simple cells. 
The model cells are interconnected by long-range horizontal connections in a pattern 
similar to the co-circular connectivity pattern of Parent and Zucker (1989), as well as the 
"association field" proposed by Field et al. (1993). For each cell with preferred 
orientation, 0, the orientations, p, of the pre-synaptic cell at position (i,j) relative to the 
post-synaptic cell, are specified by: 
cp(O,i, j)= 2 tan-' (3/- 0 
(see Figure 1 a). These excitatory connections are confined to two regions, one flaring out 
along the axis of orientation of the cell (co-axial), and another confined to a narrow zone 
extending orthogonally to the axis of orientation (trans-axial). The fan-out of the co-axial 
connections is limited to low curvature deviations from the orientation axis while the 
trans-axial connections are limited to a narrow region orthogonal to the cell's orientation 
axis. These constraints are expressed as: 
1, if tan-'()-O < lc, 
F(O,i,j, gt)= 1, iftan -l -0=+œ, 
O, otherwise. 
where c represents the maximum angular deviation from the orientation axis of the post- 
synaptic cell and œ represents the maximum angular deviation from the orthogonal axis of 
the post-synaptic cell. Connection weights decrease for positions with increasing angular 
deviation from the orientation axis of the cell, as well as positions with increasing 
distance, in agreement with the physiological and psychophysical findings. Figure lb 
illustrates the connectivity pattern. There is physiological, anatomical and 
psychophysical evidence consistent with the existence of both sets of connections (Nelson 
and Frost, 1985; Kapadia et al., 1995; Rockland and Lund, 1983; Lund et al., 1985; 
Fitzpatrick, 1996; Polat and Sagi, 1993, 1994). 
Cells that are facilitated by the connections inhibit neighboring cells that lie outside the 
facilitatory zones. The magnitude of the inhibition is such that only cells receiving 
strong support are able to remain active. This is consistent with the physiological 
findings of Nelson and Frost (1985) and Kapadia et al. (1995) as well as the intra-cellular 
recordings of Weliky et al. (1995) which show EPSPs followed by IPSPs when the long- 
distance connections were stimulated. This inhibition is thought to occur through di- 
synaptic pathways. 
In the model, cells are assumed to enter a "bursting mode" in which they synchronize 
with other bursting cells. In cortex, bursting has been associated with supragranular 
"chattering cells" (Gray and McCormick (1996). In the model, cells that enter the bursting

mode are modeled as homogeneous coupled neural oscillators with a common fundamental 
frequency but different phases (Kopell and Ermentrout, 1986; Baldi and Meir, 1990). The 
ph. ase of each oscillator is modulated by the phase of the oscillators to which it is 
coupled. Oscillators are coupled only to other oscillators with which they have strong, 
reciprocal, connections. The oscillators synchronize using a simple phase averaging rule: 
woOj(t- 1) 
0 i (t) = , wii = 1 
wij 
where 6 represents the phase of the oscillator and w 0 represents the weight of the 
connection between oscillator i and j. The oscillators synchronize iteratively with 
synchronization defined as the following condition: 
IOi(t)-Oj(t) < tS, i,j  C, t<tma x 
where C represents all the coupled oscillators on the same contour, 6 represents the 
maximum phase difference between oscillators, and truax represents the maximum number 
of time steps the oscillators are allowed to synchronize. The salience of the chain is then 
represented by the sum of the activities of all the synchronized elements in the group, C. 
The chain with the highest salience is chosen as the output of the network. This allows 
us to compare the output of the model to psychophysical results on contour extraction. 
It has been postulated that the 40 Hz oscillations observed in the cortex may be 
responsible for perceptual binding across different cortical regions (Singer and Gray, 
1995). Recent studies have questioned the functional significance and even the existence 
of these oscillations (Ghose and Freeman, 1992; Bair et al., 1994). We use neural 
oscillators only as a simple functional means of computing synchronization and make no 
assumption regarding their possible role in cortex.

3 RESULTS 
This model was tested by simulating a number of psychophysical experiments. A 
number of model parameters remain to be defined through further physiological and 
psychophysical experiments, thus we only attempt a qualitative fit to the data. All 
simulations were conducted with the same parameter set. 
3.1 EXTRACTION OF SALIENT CONTOURS 
Using the same methods as Field et al. (1993), we tested the model's ability to extract 
contours embedded in noise (see' Figure 2). Pairs of stimulus arrays were presented to the 
918 S. Yen and L. H. Finkel 
network, one array contains a contour, the other contains only randomly oriented 
elements. The network determines the stimulus containing the contour with the highest 
salience. Network performance was measured by computing the percentage of correct 
detection. The network was tested on a range of stimulus variables governing the target 
contour: 1) the angle, , between elements on a contour, 2) the angle between elements 
on a contour but with the elements aligned orthogonal to the contour passing through 
them, 3) the angle between elements with a random offset angle, _+(, with respect to the 
contour passing through them, and 4) average separation of the elements. 500 
simulations were run at each data point. The results are shown in Figure 2. The model 
shows good qualitative agreement with the psychophysical data. When the elements are 
aligned, the performance of the network is mostly modulated by the co-axial connections, 
whereas when the elements are oriented orthogonal to the contour, the trans-axial 
connections mediate performance. Both the model and human subjects are adversely 
affected as the weights between consecutive elements decrease in strength. This reduces 
the length of the contour and thus the saliency of the stimulus.

consisted of 2S6 randomly oriented Gabor patches with 12 elements aligned to form a contour. Each data 
point represents results for 00 simulations. 
3.2 EFFECTS OF CONTOUR CLOSURE 
In a series of experiments using similar stimuli to Field et al. (1993), Kov;ics and Julesz 
(1993) found that closed contours are much more salient than open contours. They 
reported that when the inter-element spacing between all elements was gradually increased, 
the maximum inter-element separation for detecting closed contours, A (defined at 75% 
performance), is higher than that for open contours, A o. In addition, they showed that 
when elements spaced at A o are added to a "jagged" (open) contour, the saliency of the 
contour increases monotonically but when elements spaced at A are added to a circular 
contour, the saliency does not change until the last element is added and the contour 
becomes closed. In fact, at A, the contour is not salient until it is closed, at which point 
it suddenly "pops-out" (see Figure 3c). This finding places a strong constraint on the 
computation of saliency in visual perception. 
Interestingly, it has been shown that synchronization in a chain of coupled neural 
oscillators is enhanced when the chain is closed (Kopell and Ermentrout, 1986; 
Ermentrout, 1985; Somers and Kopell, 1993). This property seems to be related to the 
differences in boundary effects on synchronization between open and closed chains and 
appears to hold across different families of coupled oscillators. It has also been shown 
that synchronization is dependent on the coupling between oscillators -- the stronger the 
coupling, the better the synchronization, both in terms of speed and coherence (Somers 
Salient Contour Extraction by Temporal Binding in a Cortically-based Network 919 
and Kopell, 1993; Wang, 1995). We believe these findings may apply to the 
psychophysical results. 
As in Kovfics and Julesz (1993), the network is presented with two stimuli, one 
containing a contour and the other made up of all randomly oriented elements. The 
network picks the stimulus containing the synchronized contour with the higher salience. 
In separate trials, the threshold for maximum separation between elements was determined 
for open and closed contours. The ratio of the separation of the background elements to 
the that of elements on a closed curve, q0 c, was found to be 0.6 (which is similar to the 
threshold of 0.65 recently reported by Kovfics et al., 1996), whereas the ratio for open 
contours, q0 o, was found to be 0.9. (A is the threshold separation of contour elements, 
at a particular background separation). We then examined the changes in salience for open 
and closed contours. The performance of the network was measured as additional elements 
were added to an initial short contour of elements. The results are shown in Figure 3b. 
At q0o, both open and closed contours are synchronized but at q0c, elements are 
synchronized only when the chains are closed. If salience can only be computed for 
synchronized contours, then as additional elements are added to an open chain at q0o, the 
salience would increase since the whole chain is synchronized. On the other hand, at 
as long as the last element is missing, the chain is really an open chain, and since q0 is 
smaller than q0 o, the elements on the chain will not be able to synchronize and adding 
elements has no effect on salience. Once the last element is added, the chain is 
immediately able to synchronize and the salience of the contour increases dramatically and 
causes the contour to "pop-out".

contours were made up of 17 elements. c) The data from Kov,4cs and Julesz (1993) are re-plotted for

3.3 REAL IMAGES 
A stringent test of the model's capabilities is the ability to extract perceptually salient 
contours in real images. Figure 4 and 5 show results for a typical image. The original 
grayscale image, the output of the steerable filters, and the output of the model are shown 
in Figure 4a,b,c and Figure 5a,b,c respectively. The network is able to extract some of 
the more salient contours and ignore other high contrast edges detected by the steerable 
filters. Both simulations used filters at only one spatial scale and could be improved 
through interactions across multiple spatial frequencies. Nevertheless, the model shows 
promise for automated image processing applications

CONCLUSION 
We have presented a cortically-based model that is able to identify perceptually salient 
contours in images containing high levels of noise. The model is based on the use of 
long distance intracortical connections that facilitate the responses of cells lying along 
smooth contours. Salience is defined as the combined activity of the synchronized 
population of cells responding to a particular contour. The model qualitatively accounts 
for a range of physiological and psychophysical results and can be used in extracting 
salient contours in real images.
