Abstract 
The KBANN approach uses neural networks to refine knowledge that can 
be written in the form of simple propositional rules. We extend this idea 
further by presenting the MANNCON algorithm by which the mathematical 
equations governing a PID controller determine the topology and initial 
weights of a network, which is further trained using backpropagation. We 
apply this method to the task of controlling the outflow and temperature 
of a water tank, producing statistically-significant gains in accuracy over 
both a standard neural network approach and a non-learning PID con- 
troller. Furthermore, using the PID knowledge to initialize the weights of 
the network produces statistically less variation in testset accuracy when 
compared to networks initialized with small random numbers. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Research into the design of neural networks for process control has largely ignored 
existing knowledge about the task at hand. One form this knowledge (often called 
the "domain theory") can take is embodied in traditional controller paradigms. The

recently-developed KBANN (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) approach 
(Towell et al., 1990) addresses this issue for tasks for which a domain theory (written 
using simple propositional rules) is available. The basis of this approach is to use 
the existing knowledge to determine an appropriate network topology and initial 
weights, such that the network begins its learning process at a "good" starting 
point. 
This paper describes the MANNCON (Multivariable Artificial Neural Network Con- 
trol) algorithm, a method of using a traditional controller paradigm to determine 
the topology and initial weights of a network. The used of a PID controller in this 
way eliminates network-design problems such as the choice of network topology 
(i.e., the number of hidden units) and reduces the sensitivity of the network to the 
initial values of the weights. Furthermore, the initial configuration of the network 
is closer to its final state than it would normally be in a randomly-configured net- 
work. Thus, the MANNCON networks perform better and more consistently than 
the standard, randomly-initialized three-layer approach. 
The task we examine here is learning to control a Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output 
(MIMO) system. There are a number of reasons to investigate this task using neu- 
ral networks. One, it usually involves nonlinear input-output relationships, which 
matches the nonlinear nature of neural networks. Two, there have been a number 
of successful applications of neural networks to this task (Bhat & McAvoy, 1990; 
Jordan & Jacobs, 1990; Miller et al., 1990). Finally, there are a number of existing 
controller paradigms which can be used to determine the topology and the initial 
weights of the network. 
2 CONTROLLER NETWORKS 
The MANNCON algorithm uses a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller 
(Stephanopoulos, 1984), one of the simplest of the traditional feedback controller 
schemes, as the basis for the construction and initialization of a neural network con- 
troller. The basic idea of PID control is that the control action u (a vector) should 
be proportional to the error, the integral of the error over time, and the temporal 
derivative of the error. Several tuning parameters determine the contribution of 
these various components. Figure 1 depicts the resulting network topology based 
on the PID controller paradigm. The first layer of the network, that from y,p (de- 
sired process output or setpoint) and Y(n-) (actual process output of the past time 
step), calculates the simple error (e). A simple vector difference, 
e: y,p -- y 
accomplishes this. The second layer, that between e, e(n-x), and e, calculates the 
actual error to be passed to the PID mechanism. In effect, this layer acts as a 
steady-state pre-compensator (Ray, 1981), where 
e = Gie 
and produces the current error and the error signals at the past two time steps. 
This compensator is a constant matrix, Gi, with values such that interactions at a 
steady state between the various control loops are eliminated. The final layer, that 
between e and u(n) (controller output/plant input), calculates the controller action

UC(n) = UC(n_I) -'[- WCOel(n) q- WClel(n_I) q- WC2el(n-2) 
where woo, we1, and we2 are constants determined by the tuning parameters of the 
controller for that loop. A similar set of equations and constants (wHO, WIll, WH2) 
exist for the other controller loop. 
Figure 2 shows a schematic of the water tank (Ray, 1981) that the network con- 
trols. This figure also shows the controller variables (Fc and FH), the tank output 
variables (F(h) and T), and the disturbance variables (Fd and Td). The controller 
cannot measure the disturbances, which represent noise in the system. 
M^NNCON initializes the weights of Figure 1's network with values that mimic 
the behavior of a PID controller tuned with Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N) parameters 
(Stephanopoulos, 1984) at a particular operating condition. Using the KB^NN 
approach (Towell et al., 1990), it adds weights to the network such that all units 
in a layer are connected to all units in all subsequent layers, and initializes these 
weights to small random numbers several orders of magnitude smaller than the 
weights determined by the PID parameters. We scaled the inputs and outputs of 
the network to be in the range [0, 1]. 
Initializing the weights of the network in the manner given above assumes that the 
activation functions of the units in the network are linear, that is,

The strength of neural networks, however, lie in their having nonlinear (typically 
sigmoidal) activation functions. For this reason, the MaNNCON system initially sets 
the weights (and the biases of the units) so that the linear response dictated by the 
PID initialization is appro:rimated by a sigmoid over the output range of the unit. 
For units that have outputs in the range [-1, 1], the activation function becomes

where wji are the linear weights described above. 
Once MaNNCON configures and initializes the weights of the network, it uses a set 
of training examples and backpropagation to improve the accuracy of the network. 
The weights initialized with PID information, as well as those initialized with small 
random numbers, change during backpropagation training. 
3 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
We compared the performance of three networks that differed in their topology 
and/or their method of initialization. Table i summarizes the network topology 
and weight initialization method for each network. In this table, "PID topology" 
is the network structure shown in Figure 1. "Random" weight initialization sets

all weights to small random numbers centered around zero. We also compare these 
networks to a (non-learning) PID controller. 
We trained the networks using backpropagation over a randomly-determined sched- 
ule of setpoint y,p and disturbance d changes that did not repeat. The setpoints, 
which represent the desired output values that the controller is to maintain, are the 
temperature and outflow of the tank. The disturbances, which represent noise, are 
the inflow rate and temperature of a disturbance stream. The magnitudes of the 
setpoints and the disturbances formed a Gaussian distribution centered at 0.5. The 
number of training examples between changes in the setpoints and disturbances 
were exponentially distributed. 
We performed three experiments in which the characteristics of the training and/or 
testing set differed. Table 2 summarizes the range of the setpoints as well as their 
average duration for each data set in the experiments. As can be seen, in Experiment 
1, the training set and testing sets were qualitatively similar; in Experiment 2, the 
test set was of longer duration setpoints; and in Experiment 3, the training set was 
restricted to a subrange of the testing set. We periodically interrupted training and 
tested the network. Results are averaged over 10 runs (Scott, 1991). 
We used the error at the output of the tank (y in Figure 1) to determine the network 
error (at u) by propagating the error backward through the plant (Psaltis et al., 
1988). In this method, the error signal at the input to the tank is given by 
ui '- ft(nelui)  yj 
where 6ui represents the simple error at the output of the water tank and 6ui is the 
error signal at the input of the tank. Since we used a modelof the process and not a 
real tank, we can calculate the partial derivatives from the process model equations. 
4 RESULTS 
Figure 3 compares the performance of the three networks for Experiment 1. As can 
be seen, the MANNCON networks show an increase in correctness over the standard 
neural network approach. Statistical analysis of the errors using a t-test show 
that they differ significantly at the 99.5% confidence level. Furthermore, while the 
difference in performance between MANNCON network I and MANNCON network II is

not significant, the difference in the variance of the testing error over different runs 
is significant (99.5% confidence level). Finally, the MANNCON networks perform 
significantly better (99.95% confidence level) than the non-learning PID controller. 
The performance of the standard neural network represents the best of several trials 
with a varying number of hidden units ranging from 2 to 20. 
A second observation from Figure 3 is that the MANNCON networks learned much 
more quickly than the standard neural-network approach. The MANNCON networks 
required significantly fewer training instances to reach a performance level within 
5% of its final error rate. For each of the experiments, Table 3 summarizes the 
final mean error, as well as the number of training instances required to achieve a 
performance within 5% of this value. 
In Experiments 2 and 3 we again see a significant gain in correctness of the MAN- 
NCON networks over both the standard neural network approach (99.95% confidence 
level) as well as the non-learning PID controller (99.95% confidence level). In these 
experiments, the MANNCON network initialized with Z-N tuning also learned sig- 
nificantly quicker (99.95% confidence level) than the standard neural network. 
5 FUTURE WORK 
One question is whether the introduction of extra hidden units into the network 
would improve the performance by giving the network "room" to learn concepts 
that are outside the given domain theory. The addition of extra hidden units as 
well as the removal of unneeded units is an area with much ongoing research.

The "4-" indicates that the true value lies within these bounds at a 95% 
confidence level. The values given for fixed control action (5) represent 
the errors resulting from fixing the control actions at a level that produces 
outputs of [0.5, 0.5] at steady state. 
"Ringing" (rapid changes in controller actions) occurred in some of the trained 
networks. A future enhancement of this approach would be to create a network 
architecture that prevented this ringing, perhaps by limiting the changes in the 
controller actions to some relatively small values. 
Another important goal of this approach is the application of it to other real-world 
processes. The water tank in this project, while illustrative of the approach, was 
quite simple. Much more difficult problems (such as those containing significant 
time delays) exist and should be explored. 
There are several other controller paradigms that could be used as a basis for net- 
work construction and initialization. There are several different digital controllers, 
such as Deadbeat or Dahlin's (Stephanopoulos, 1984), that could be used in place 
of the digital PID controller used in this project. Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC) 
(Pratt et al., 1980) and Internal Model Control (IMC) (Garcia & Morari, 1982) are 
also candidates for consideration for this approach. 
Finally, neural networks are generally considered to be "black boxes," in that their 
inner workings are completely uninterpretable. Since the neural networks in this 
approach are initialized with information, it may be possible to interpret the weights 
of the network and extract useful information from the trained network.

6 CONCLUSIONS 
We have described the MANNCON algorithm, which uses the information from a 
PID controller to determine a relevant network topology without resorting to trial- 
and-error methods. In addition, the algorithm, through initialization of the weights 
with prior knowledge, gives the backpropagtion algorithm an appropriate direction 
in which to continue learning. Finally, we have shown that using the MANNCON 
algorithm significantly improves the performance of the trained network in the fol- 
lowing ways: 
ß Improved mean testset accuracy 
ß Less variability between runs 
ß Faster rate of learning 
ß Better generalization and extrapolation ability
