Abstract 
We propose a paradigm for modeling speech production based on neural 
networks. We focus on characteristics of the musculoskeletal system. Using 
real physiological data - articulator movements and EMG from muscle activity - 
a neural network learns the forward dynamics relating motor commands to 
muscles and the ensuing articulator behavior. After learning, simulated 
perturbations, were used to asses properties of the acquired model, such as natural 
frequency, damping, and interarticulator couplings. Finally, a cascade neural 
network is used to generate continuous motor commands from a sequence of 
discrete articulatory targets. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A key problem in the formal study of human language is to understand the process by 
which linguistic intentions become speech. Speech production entails extraordinary 
coordination among diverse neurophysiological and anatomical structures from which 
unfolds through time a complex acoustic signal that conveys to listeners something of 
the speaker's intention. Analysis of the speech acoustics has not revealed the encoding of 
these intentions, generally conceived to be ordered strings of some basic unit, e.g., the 
phoneme. Nor has analysis of the articulatory system provided an answer, although 
recent pioneering work by Jordan (1986), Saltzman (1986), Laboissire (1990) and others 
191 
192 Hirayama, Vatikiotis-Bateson, Kawato, and Jordan 
has brought us closer to an understanding of the articulatory-to-acoustic transform and has 
demonstrated the importance of modeling the articulatory system's temporal properties. 
However, these efforts have been limited to kinematic modeling because they have not 
had access to the neuromuscular activity of the articulatory structures. 
In this study, we are using neural networks to model speech production. The principle 
steps of this endeavor are shown in Figure 1. In this paper, we focus on characteristics of 
the musculoskeletal system. Using real physiological data - articulator movements and 
EMG from muscle activity - a neural network learns the forward dynamics relating motor 
commands to muscles and the ensuing articulator behavior. After learning, a cascade 
neural network model (Kawato, Maeda, Uno, & Suzuki, 1990) is used to generate 
continuous motor commands.

2 EXPERIMENT 
Movement, EMG, and acoustic data were recorded for one speaker who produced reiterant 
versions of two sentences. Speaking rate was fast and the reiterant syllables were ba, bo. 
Figure 2 shows approximate marker positions for tracking positions of the jaw 
(horizontal and vertical) and lips (vertical only) and muscle insertion points for hooked- 
wire, bipolar EMG recording from four muscles: ABD (anterior belly of the digaslric) for 
jaw lowering, OOI(orbicularis offs inferior) and MTL (mentalis) for lower lip raising and 
protrusion, and GGA (genioglossus anterior) for tongue tip lowering. 
All movement and EMG (rectified and integrated) signals were digitized (12 bit) at 200 Hz 
and then numerically smoothed at 40 Hz. Position signals were differentiated to obtain 
velocity and then, after smoothing at 22 Hz, differentiated again to get acceleration.

FORWARD DYNAMICS MODELING OF THE MUSCULO- 
SKELETAL SYSTEM AND TRAJECTORY PREDICTION 
FROM MUSCLE EMG 
The forward dynamics model (FDM) for ba, bo production was obtained using a three- 
layer perceptron with back propagation (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986). The 
network learns the correlations between position, velocity, EMG at time t and the 
changes of position and velocity for all articulators at the next time sample t+l. 
After learning, the forward dynamics model is connected recurrently as shown in Figure 4. 
The network uses only the initial articulator position and velocity values and the 
continuous EMG "motor command" input to generate predicted trajectories. The FDM 
estimates the changes of position and velocity and sums them with position and velocity 
values of the previous sample t to obtain estimated values at the next sample t+l. 
Figure 5 compares experimentally observed trajectories with trajectories predicted by this 
network. Spatiotemporal characterstics are very similar, e.g., amplitude, frequency, and 
phase, and demonstrate the generally good performance of the model. There is, however, 
a tendency towards negative offset in the predicted positions. There are two important 
limitations that reduce the current model's ability to compensate for position shifts in the 
test utterance. First, there is no specified equilibrium or rest position in articulator space, 
towards which articulators might tend in the absence of EMG activity. Second, the 
acquired FDM is based on limited EMG; at most there is correlated EMG for only one 
direction of motion per articulator. Addition of antagonist EMG and/or an estimate of 
equilibrium position in articulator or, eventually, task coordinates should increase the 
model's generalization capability.

4 ESTIMATION OF DYNAMIC PARAMETER 
To investigate quantitative characteristics of the obtained forward dynamics model, the 
model system's response to two types of simulated perturbation were examined. 
The first simulated perturbation confirmed that the model system indeed learned an 
appropriate nonlinear dynamics and affords a rough estimation of the its visco-elastic 
properties, such as natural frequency (1.0 Hz) and damping ratio (0.24). Simulated release 
of the lower lip at various distances from rest revealed underdamped though stable 
behavior, as shown in Figure 6a. 
The second perturbation entailed observing articulator response to a step increase (50 % of 
full-scale) in EMG activity for each muscle. Figure 6b demonstrates that the learned 
relation between EMG input and articulator movement output is dynamical rather than 
kinematic because articulator responses are not instantaneous. Learned responses to each 
muscle's activation also show some interesting and reasonable (though not always correct) 
couplings between different articulators.

5 MOTOR COMMAND GENERATION USING CASCADE 
NEURAL NETWORK MODEL 
Observed articulator movements are smooth. Their smoothness is due partly to physical 
dynamic properties (inertia, viscosity). Furthermore, smoothness may be an attribute of 
the motor command itself, thereby resolving the ill-posed computational problem of 
generating continuous motor commands from a small number of discrete articulatory 
targets. 
To test this, we incorporated a smoothness constraint on the motor command (rectified 
EMG, in this case), which is conceptually similar to previously proposed constraints on 
change of torque (Uno, Kawato, & Suzuki, 1989) and muscle-tension (Uno, Suzuki, & 
Kawato, 1989). Two articulatory target (via-point) constraints were specified spatially, 
one for consonant closure and the other for vowel opening, and assigned to each of the 21 
consonant + vowel syllables. The alternating sequence of via-points was isochronous 
(temporally equidistant) except for initial, medial and final pauses. The cascade neural 
network (Figure 7) then generated smooth EMG and articulator trajectories whose 
spatiotemporal asymmetry approximated the prosodic patterning of the natural test 
utterances (Figure 8). Although this is only a preliminary implementation of via-point 
and smoothness constraints, the model's ability to generate trajectories of appropriate 
spatiotemporal complexity from a series of alternating via-point inputs is encouraging.

6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Our intent here has been to provide a preliminary model of speech production based on the 
articulatory system's dynamical properties. We used real physiological data m EMG m 
to obtain the forward dynamics model of the articulators from a multilayer perceptron. 
After training, a recurrent network predicted articulator trajectories using the EMG signals 
as the motor command input. Simulated perturbations were used to examine the model 
system's response to isolated inputs and to assess its visco-elastic properties and 
interarticulator couplings. Then, we incorporated a reasonable smoothness criterion  
minimum-motor-command-change -- into a cascade neural network that generated 
realistic trajectories from a bead-like string of via-points. 
We are now attempting to model various styles of real speech using data from more 
muscles and articulators such as the tongue. Also, the scope of the model is being 
expanded to incorporate global performance parameters for motor command generation, 
and the transformations from phoneme to articulatory gesture and from articulatory 
movement to acoustic signal. 
Finally, a main goal of our work is to develop engineering applications for speech 
synthesis and recognition. Although our model is still preliminary, we believe resolving 
the difficulties posed by coarticulation, segmentation, prosody, and speaking style 
ultimately depends on understanding physiological and computational aspects of speech 
motor control.
