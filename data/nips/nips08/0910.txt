Abstract 
State-of-the-art speech processors in cochlear implants perform 
channel selection using a spectral maxima strategy. This strategy 
can lead to confusions when high frequency features are needed 
to discriminate between sounds. We present in this paper a novel 
channel selection strategy based upon pattern recognition which al- 
lows "smart" channel selections to be made. The proposed strategy 
is implemented using multi-layer perceptrons trained on a multi- 
speaker labelled speech database. The input to the network are the 
energy coefficients of N energy channels. The output of the system 
are the indices of the M selected channels. 
We compare the performance of our proposed system to that of 
spectral maxima strategy, and show that our strategy can produce 
significantly better results. 
I INTRODUCTION 
A cochlear implant is a device used to provide the sensation of sound to those who 
are profoundly deaf by means of electrical stimulation of residual auditory neurons. 
It generally consists of a directional microphone, a wearable speech processor, a 
head-set transmitter and an implanted receiver-stimulator module with an electrode

array which all together provide an electrical representation of the speech signal to 
the residual nerve fibres of the peripheral auditory system (Clark et al, 1990).

A simplified schematic diagram of the cochlear implants is shown in Figure 1. Speech 
sounds are picked up by the directional microphone and sent to the speech processor. 
The speech processor amplifies, filters and digitizes these signals, and then selects 
and codes the appropriate sound information. The coded signal contains informa- 
tion as to which electrode to stimulate and the intensi[y level required to generate 
the appropriate sound sensations. The signal is then sent to the receiver/stimulator 
via the transmitter coil. The receiver/stimulator delivers electrical impulses to the 
appropriate electrodes in the cochlea. These stimulated electrodes then directly 
activate the hearing nerve in the inner ear, creating the sensation of sound, which 
is then forwarded to the brain for interpretation. The entire process happens in 
milliseconds. 
For multi-channel cochlear implants, the task of the speech processor is to compute 
the spectral energy of the electrical signals it receives, and to quantise them into 
different levels. The energy spectrum is commonly divided into separate bands using 
a filter bank of N (typically 20) bandpass filters with centre frequencies ranging from 
250 Hz to 10 KHz. The bands of energy are allocated to electrodes in the patient's 
implant on a one-to-one basis. Usually the most-apical bipolar electrode pairs are 
allocated to the channels in tonotopic order. The limitations of implant systems 
usually require only a selected number of the quantised energy levels to be fed to 
the implanted electrode array (Abbas, 1993; Schouten, 1992). 
The state-of-the-art speech processor for multi-channel implants performs channel 
selection using spectral maxima strategy (McDermott et al, 1992; Seligman & Mc- 
Dermott, 1994). The maxima strategy selects the M (about 6) largest spectral 
energy of the frequency spectrum as stimulation channels from a filter bank of 
N (typically 20) bandpass. It is believed that compared to other channel selec- 
tion techniques (FOF2, FOFiF2, MPEAK ... ), the maxima strategy increases the 
amount of spectral information and improves the speech perception and recognition 
performance. 
However, maxima strategy relies heavily on the highest energies. This often leads 
to the same levels being selected for different sounds, as the energy levels that 
distinguish them are not high enough to be selected. For some speech signals,

it does not cater for confusions and cannot discriminate between high frequency 
features. 
We present in this paper Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) techniques for imple- 
menting "smart" channel selection for cochlear implant systems. The input to the 
proposed channel selection system consists of the energy coefficients (18 in our 
experiments) and the output the indices of the selected channels (6 in our exper- 
iments). The neural network based selection system is trained on a multi-speaker 
labelled speech and has been evaluated on a separated multi-speaker database not 
used in the training phase. The most important feature of our ANN based channel 
selection system is its ability to select the channels for stimulation on the basis of 
the overall morphology of the energy spectrum and not only on the basis of the 
maximal energy values.

THE PATTERN RECOGNITION BASED CHANNEL 
SELECTION STRATEGY 
Speech is the most natural form of human communication. The speech information 
signal can be divided into phonemes, which share some common acoustic properties 
with one another for a short interval of time. The phonemes are typically divided 
into two broad classes: (a) vowels, which allow unrestricted airflow in the vocal 
tract, and (b) consonants, which restrict airflow at some point and are weaker than 
vowels. Different phonemes have different morphology in the energy spectrum. 
Moreover, for different speakers and different speech sentences, the same phonemes 
have different energy spectrum morphologies (Kent 8z Read, 1992). Therefore, 
simple methods to select some of the most important channels for all the phoneme 
patterns will not perform as good as the method that considers the spectrum in its 
entirety. 
The existing maxima strategy only refers to the spectrum amplitudes found in the 
entire estimated spectrum without considering the morphology. Typically several 
of the maxima results can be obtained from a single spectral peak. Therefore, for 
some phoneme patterns, the selection result is good enough to represent the orig- 
inal phoneme. But for some others, some important tbatures of the phoneme are 
lost. This usually happens to those phonemes with important features in the high 
frequency region. Due to the low amplitude of the high frequency in the spectrum 
morphology, maxima methods are not capable to extract those high frequency fea- 
tures. The relationship between the desired M output channels and the energy 
spectrum patterns is complex, and depending on the conditions, may be influenced 
by many factors. As mentioned in the Introduction, channel selection methods that 
make use of local information only in the energy spectrum are bound to produce 
channel sub-sets where sounds may be confused. The confusions can be reduced if 
"global" information of the energy spectrum is used in the selection process. 
The channel selection approach we are proposing makes use of the overall energy 
spectrum. This is achieved by turning the selection problem into that of a spec- 
trum morphology pattern recognition one and hence, we call our approach Pattern 
Recognition based Channel Selection (PRCS).

2.1 PRCS STRATEGY 
The PRCS strategy is implemented using two cascaded neural networks shown in 
Figure 2: 
Spectral morphological classifier: Its inputs are the spectrum energy am- 
plitudes of all the channels and its outputs all the transformations of the 
inputs. The transformation between input and output can be seen as a 
recognition, emphasis, and/or decaying of the inputs. The consequence is 
that some inputs are amplified and some decayed, depending on the mor- 
phology of the spectrum. The classifier performs a non-linear mapping. 
M strongest of N classifier: It receives the output of morphological classifier 
and applies a M strongest selection rule.

2.2 TRAINING AND TESTING DATA 
The most difficult task in developing the proposed PRCS is to set up the labelled 
training and testing data for the spectral morphological classifier. 
The training and testing data sets have been constructed using the process shown 
in Figure 3.

Figure 3: The process of generating training and testing sets 
The sounds in the data sets are speech extracted from the DARPA TIMIT multi- 
speaker speech corpus (Fisher et al, 1987) which contains a total of 6300 sentences, 
10 sentences spoken by each of 630 speakers. The speech signal is sampled at 16KHz 
rate with 16 bit precision. As the speech is nonstationary, to produce the energy 
spectrum versus channel numbers, a short-time speech analysis method is used. 
The Fast Fourier Transform with 8ms smooth Hamming window technique is ap- 
plied to yield the energy spectrum. The hamming window has the shape of a raised

cosine pulse: 
h(n)- 0.54-0.46cos -a] for0_n_N-1 
0 otherwise 
The time frame on which the speech analysis is performed is 4ms long and the 
successive time frame windows overlap by 50%. 
Using frequency allocations similar to that used in commercial cochlear implant 
speech processors, the frequency range in the spectrum is divided into 18 channels 
with each channel having the center frequencies of 250, 450, 650, 850 1050, 1250, 
1450, 1650, 1895, 2177, 2500, 2873, 3300, 3866, 4530, 5307, 6218 and 7285Hz 
respectively. Each energy spectrum from a time frame is quantised into these 18 
frequency bands. The energy amplitude for each level is the sum of the amplitude 
value of the energy for all the frequency components in the level. 
The quantised energy spectrum is then labelled using a graphics based tool, called 
LABEL, developed specially for this application. LABEL displays the spectrum 
pattern including the unquantised spectrum, the signal source, speaker's name, 
speech sentence, phoneme, signal pre-processing method and FFT results. All these 
information assists labelling experts to allocate a score (1 to 18) to each channel. 
The score reflects the importance of the information provided by each of the bands. 
Hence, if six channels are only to be selected, the channels with the score i to 6 
can be used and are highlighted. The labelling is necessary as a supervised neural 
network training method is being used. 
A total of 5000 energy spectrum patterns have been labelled. They are from 20 
different speakers and different spoken sentences. Of the 5000 example patterns, 
4000 patterns are allocated for training and 1000 patterns for testing. 
3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
We have implemented and tested the PRCS system as described above and our 
experiments show that it has better performance than channel selection systems 
used in present cochlear implant processors. 
The PRCS system is effectively constructed as a multi-module neural network using 
MUME (Jabri et al, 1994). The back-propagation algorithm in an on-line mode is 
used to train the MLP. The training patterns input components are the energy 
amplitudes of the 18 channels and the teacher component consists of a "1" for a 
channel to be selected and "0" for all others. The MLP is trained for up to 2000 
epochs or when a minimum total mean squared error is reached. A learning rate  
of 0.01 is used (no weight decay). 
We show the average performance of our PRCS in Table i where we also show the 
performance of a leading commercial spectral maxima strategy called SPEAK on 
the same test set. In the first column of this table we show the number of channels 
that matched out of the 6 desired channels. For example, the first row corresponds 
to the case where all 6 channels match the desired 6 channels in the test data base, 
and so on. As Table i shows, the PRCS produces a significantly better performance 
than the commercial strategy on the speech test set. 
The selection performance to different phonemes is listed in Table 2. It clearly

shows that the PRCS strategy can cater for the features of all the speech spectrum 
patterns. 
To compare the practical performance of the PRCS with the maxima strategies 
we have developed a direct performance test system which allows us to play the 
synthesized speech of the selected channels through post-speech synthesizer. Our 
test shows that the PRCS produces more intelligible speech to the normal ears. 
Sixteen different sentences spoken by sixteen people are tested using both maxima 
and PRCS methods. It is found that the synthesized speech from PRCS has much 
more high frequency features than that of the speech produced by the maxima 
strategy. All listeners who were asked to take the test agreed that the quality of the 
speech sound from PRCS is much better than those from the commercial maxima 
channel selection system. The tape recording of the synthesized speech will be 
available at the conference. 
4 CONCLUSION 
A pattern recognition based channel selection strategy for Cochlear Implants has 
been presented. The strategy is based on a 18-72-18 MLP srongest selector. The 
proposed channel selection strategy has been compared to a leading commercial 
technique. Our simulation and play back results show that our machine learning 
based technique produces significantly better channel selections.
