ABSTRACT 
We propose a new neural network model and its learning 
algorithm. The proposed neural network consists of four layers 
- input, hidden, output and final output layers. The hidden and 
output layers are multiple. Using the proposed SICL(Spread 
Pattern Information and Cooperative Learning) algorithm, it 
is possible to learn analog data accurately and to obtain 
smooth outputs. Using this neural network, we have developed 
a speech production system consisting of a phonemic symbol 
production subsystem and a speech parameter production 
subsystem. We have succeeded in producing natural speech 
waves with high accuracy. 
INTRODUCTION 
Our purpose is to produce natural speech waves. In general, speech synthesis 
by rule is used for producing speech waves. However, there are some 
difficulties in speech synthesis by rule. First, the rules are very complicated. 
Second, extracting a generalized rule is difficult. Therefore, it is hard to 
synthesize a natural speech wave by using rules. We use a neural network for 
producing speech waves. Using a neural network, it is possible to learn speech 
parameters without rules. (Instead of describing rules explicitly, selecting a 
training data set becomes an important subject.) In this paper, we propose a 
new neural network model and its learning algorithm. Using the proposed 
neural network, it is possible to learn and produce analog data accurately. We 
apply the network to a speech production system and examine the system 
performance. 
PROPOSED NEURAL NETWORK AND ITS LEARNING 
ALGORITHM 
We use an analog neuron-like element in a neural network. The element has a 
logistic activation function presented by equation (3). As a learning algorithm, 
Speech Production Using A Neural Network 233 
the BP(Back Propagation) method is widely used. By using this method it is 
possible to learn the weighting coefficients of the units whose target values are 
not given directly. However, there are disadvantages. First, there are singular 
points at 0 and 1 (outputs of the neuron-like element). Second, finding the 
optimum values of learning constants is not easy. We have proposed a new 
neural network model and its learning algorithm to solve this problem. The 
proposed SICL(Spread Pattern Information and Cooperative Learning) method 
has the following features. 
(a)The singular points of the BP method are removed. (Outputs are not simply 
0 or 1.) This improves the convergence rate. 
(b)A spread pattern information(SI) learning algorithm is proposed. In the SI 
learning algorithm, the weighting coefficients from the hidden layers to the 
output layers are fixed to random values. Pattern information is spread over 
the memory space of the weighting coefficients. As a result, the network can 
learn analog data accurately. 
(c)A cooperative learning(CL) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm makes it 
possible to obtain smooth and stable output. The CL system is shown in Fig. 1 
where D(L) is a delay line which delays L time units. 
In the following sections, we define a three-layer network, introduce the BP 
method, and propose the SICL method.

THREE-LAYER NETWORK 
We define a three-layer network that has an input layer, a hidden layer, and 
an output layer. The propagation of a signal from the input layer to the hidden 
layer is represented as follows. 
Uj = iW" ijXi , yj = f( uj -Oj ) , (1) 
where i= 1,2,...,I; j-1,2,...,J and xi is an input, yj the output of the hidden 
layer, and Oj a threshold value. The propagation of a signal from the hidden 
layer to the output layer is represented as follows. 
ok = r. jw. ojyj, zk = f(vk- 0k), (2) 
where zk is the output of the output layer and k- 1,2,...,K. The activation 
function f(u) is defined by 
flu) = (1 +exp(-u+0))-I. (3) 
Settingy = f(u), the derivation off(u) is then given by f' (u) = y(1-y). 
BACK PROPAGATION (BP) METHOD 
The three-layer BP algorithm is shown as follows. The back propagation error, 
ok(n) , for an output unit is given by 
Ok(n) = (tk(n) - z k (n)) f' (vk(n)) , (4) 
where n is an iteration number. 
The back propagation error, b'nj(n), for a hidden unit is given by 
oj(n) = (,k5Ok(n) w. Ojk) f' (u(n)) . (5) 
The change to the weight from the i-th to thej-th unit, AwHij(n) is given by 
AwH/j(n) =ao"nj(n)xi(n) + fiAwsij(n-1) . (6) 
The change to the weight from thej-th to the k-th unit, AwHOjk(n) is given by 
Aw"ojk(n)= aOk(n) yj(n) + fiAwHOjk(n-1) , (7) 
where a and fi are learning constants, and have positive values. 
SPREAD PATTERN INFORMATION AND 
COOPERATIVE LEARNING (SICL) METHOD 
The proposed learning algorithm - SICL method is shown as follows. The 
propagation of a signal from the input layer to the hidden layer is given by 
uj(I,n)= iw"ij(l,n-1) xi(n) , yj(l,n)=f(uj(I,n) -Oj(I)) , (8) 
where ! is a stage number (! = -L/2,...,L/2). The propagation of a signal from the 
hidden layer to the output layer is given by 
vk(l,n)= jwHOjk(I) yj(n), zk(l,n)=f(vk(l,n) -0k(/)) ß (9) 
The back propagation error, ok(n), for an output unit is given by 
Speech Production Using A Neural Network 235 
8ok(l,n) = (tl(l,n)-z l(l,n)) (z l(l,n)(1-z k(/,n))'+ 7 ), (10) 
where 7 is a constant for removing singular points. 
The back propagation error, 6j(l,n), for a hidden unit is given by 
oj(l,n) = (ok(l,n) wsOjk(l)) (yj(l,n)(1-yj(l,n)) + y). (11) 
The change to the weight from the i-th to thej-th unit, Awmo(l,n) is given by 
(12) 
A wm ij( l,n) = a6j( l,n)xi(n) + fiA wm ij( l,n-1) . 
The weight from thej-th to the k-th unit, wnOjk(l) is given by 
w. oj(l)= cid(l), 
(13) 
where cid(l) is a fixed value and a random number with normal distribution. A 
final output is a weighting sum of outputs zl(I,n) ,and is given by 
Zrk( n ) =lWlZk(I,n). (14)

The Speech Production System Using the Proposed Neural Network 
In the automatic speech parameter extraction subsystemS, speech 
parameters are extracted automatically from an input speech signal. Speech 
parameters are composed of source parameters(voiced/unvoiced ratio, pitch 
and source power) and a vocal tract area function(PARCOR coefficients). The 
extracted speech parameters are used as training data of the speech parameter 
production subsystem. 
In the speech parameter production subsystemS, input is the string of 
phonemic symbols. (In the training stage, phonemic symbols are decided by the 
teacher using input speech data. After training, phonemic symbols are given 
by phonemic symbol production subsystem.) Targets are speech parameters 
extracted in . 
The phonemic symbol production subsystem  consists of a preprocessor and a 
learning system using the proposed neural network. In the preprocessor, a 
236 Kornura and Tanaka 
string of input characters is converted to a string of phonemic symbols with the 
mean length of utterance. The input is the string of phonemic symbols 
converted by the preprocessor. In the training stage, the targets are actual 
phonemic symbols, namely, the inputs of subsystem ) which are decided by 
the teacher. 
The output speech parameters are converted into the synthesized speech wave 
using the PARCOR synthesizer circuitS.

Input Speech Signal No. 1 
The input speech signal No.1 is [ ASAHAYAKU BANGARONI DENPOGA 
TODOITA J , that is, Japanese sentence which means that "A telegram was 
sent to the bungalow early in the morning.". This signal is a 408 frame (4.08s) 
sequence. 
Experimental Results 
In Fig. 3, the targets and the outputs of the speech parameter production 
subsystem are shown. The dotted line is the sequence of target values. The 
solid line is the sequence of output values after the training stage. In this case, 
the learning constant a is equal to 0.7 and fi to 0.2. After training, the actual 
outputs produced by SICL system agree well with the targets. 
Fig.4 (a) shows the learning behaviors of the speech parameter production 
subsystem. In this case, the input speech signal is No. 1. The learning constant 
a is equal to 0.7 and p to 0.2. The learning curve based on the SICL and SI 
Speech Production Using A Neural Network 237 
methods converged. However, the learning curve based on the BP method did 
not converge. 
Fig.4 (b) also shows the learning behaviors. The learning constant a is equal to 
0.07 and fl to 0.02. In this case, all of the learning curves converged. These 
results show that if we use the SICL or SI method instead of the BP method, we 
can obtain better results.

should be noted that the domain of convergence is very wide. From these

smooth output to be obtained.

For the first target data(V/UV, power ratio, 10 PARCOR coefficients), 12 units 
are assigned. For the second target data(pitch, source power), 2 units are 
assigned.

/ARARA_A/,/IRARAIJ, ..... ,/KARARAKA/,/KIRARAKI/,...,/SARARAS.A/, ..... 
In experiment II, a learning test for producing an arbitrary combination of the 
input phonemes ($5) was done. The learning behavior of subsystem( is shown 
in Fig.5. In this case, the first 12 target data items are trained. The other 2 
target data itet,s should be trained using another network. The upper line is a 
learning curve for the SI method, and the lower line for the SICL method. 
Some of the learning curves for the SI method didn't converge. However, the 
learning curve for the SICL method did. We can thus say that the SICL method 
is very powerful for actual use. (In this case, 400 hidden units is not sufficient 
for the size of input data. If more hidden units are used, the MSE will be small.)

Figure 5. Learning Behavior of Speech Parameter Production Subsystem 
From the experiments shown in previous section, it should be noted that using 
the SICL (Spread Pattern Information and Cooperative Learning ) method 
makes it possible to learn speech parameters or phonemic symbols stably and 
to produce more natural speech waves than those synthesized by rules. If the 
input is the combination of a word and postpositional particle, it is easy to 
produce sound for unknown input data using the proposed speech production 
system. However, the number of the hidden units and training data will be 
great. Therefore we have to make the system learn phoneroes among phoneme 
sequence. Using this training data makes it possible to produce an arbitrary 
sequence of phonemes. In experiment II, phonemic information (V/UV, power 
ratio, PARCOR coefficients) is trained. Then the range of input window was 
set to be 190 ms. For prosodic information (pitch, source power), we must use 
another network. Because, if we want to make the system learn prosodic 
information, we must set the range of input data wider than that of words. 
Using these strategies, it is possible to produce arbitrary natural speech.
