Abstract 
When a visual image consists of a figure against a background, V1 
cells are physiologically observed to give higher responses to image 
regions corresponding to the figure relative to their responses to 
the background. The medial axis of the figure also induces rela- 
tively higher responses compared to responses to other locations 
in the figure (except for the boundary between the figure and the 
background). Since the receptive fields of V1 cells are very smal- 
l compared with the global scale of the figure-ground and medial 
axis effects, it has been suggested that these effects may be caused 
by feedback from higher visual areas. I show how these effects can 
be accounted for by V1 mechanisms when the size of the figure 
is small or is of a certain scale. They are a manifestation of the 
processes of pre-attentive segmentation which detect and highlight 
the boundaries between homogeneous image regions. 
I Introduction 
Segmenting figure from ground is one of the most important visual tasks. We nei- 
ther know how to execute it on a computer in general, nor do we know how the 
brain executes it. Further, the medial axis of a figure has been Suggested as provid- 
ing a convenient skeleton representation of its shape (Blum 1973). It is therefore 
exciting to find that responses of cells in V1, which is usually considered a low level 
visual area, differentiate between figure and ground (Lamme 1995, Lamme, Zipser, 
and Spekreijse 1997, Zipser, Lamme, Schiller 1996) and highlight the medial axis 
(Lee, Mumford, Romero, and Lainme 1998). This happens even though the recep- 
tive fields in V1 are much smaller than the scale of these global and perceptually 
significant phenomena. A common assumption is that feedback from higher visual 
areas is mainly responsible for these effects. This is supported by the finding that 
the figure-ground effects in V1 can be strongly reduced or abolished by anaesthesia 
or lesions in higher visual areas (Lamme et al 1997). 
However, in a related experiment (Gallant, van Essen, and Nothdurœt 1995), Vl 
cells were found to give higher responses to global boundaries between two texture 
regions. Further, this border effect was significant only 10-15 milliseconds after the 
initial responses of the cells and was present even under anaesthesia. It is thus

plausible that Vl mechanisms is mainly responsible for the border effect. 
In this paper, I propose that the figure-ground and medial axis effects are manifes- 
tations of the border effect, at least for apropriately sized figures. The border effect 
is significant within a limited and finite distance from the figure border. Let us 
call the image region within this finite distance from the border the effective border 
region. When the size of the figure is small enough, all parts of the figure belong 
to the effective border region and can induce higher responses. This suggests that 
the figure-ground effect will be reduced or diminished as the size of the figure be- 
comes larger, and the V1 responses to regions of the figure far away from the border 
will not be significantly higher than responses to background. This suggestion is 
supported by experimental findings (Lamme et al 1997). Furthermore, the border 
effect can create secondary ripples as the effect decays with distance from the bor- 
der. Let us call the distance from the border to the ripple the ripple wavelength. 
When the size of a figure is roughly twice the ripple wavelength, the ripples from 
the two opposite borders of the figure can reinforce each other at the center of the 
figure to create the medial axis effect, which, indeed, is observed to occur only for 
figures of appropriate sizes (Lee et al 1998). 
I validate this proposal using a biologically based model of V1 with intra-cortical 
interactions between cells with nearby but not necessarily overlapping receptive 
fields. Intra-cortical interactions cause the responses of a cell be modulated by 
nearby stimuli outside its classical receptive fields -- the contextual influences that 
are observed physiologically (Knierim and van Essen 1992, Kapadia et al 1995). 
Contextual influences make V1 cells sensitive to global image features, despite their 
local receptive fields, as manifested in the border and other effects. 
2 The V1 model 
We have previously constructed a V1 model and shown it to be able to highlight 
smooth contours against a noisy background (Li 1998, 1999, 1999b) and also the 
boundaries between texture regions in images -- the border effect. Its behavior 
agrees with physiological observations (Knierim and van Essen 1992, Kapadia et 
al 1995) that the neural response to a bar is suppressed strongly by contextual 
bars of similar orientatons -- iso-orientation suppression; that the response is less 
suppressed by orthogonally or randomly oriented contextual bars; and that it is 
enhanced by contextual bars that are aligned to form a smooth contour in which 
the bar is within the receptive field -- contour enhancement. Without loss of 
generality, the model ignores color, motion, and stereo dimensions, includes mainly 
layer 2-3 orientation selective cells, and ignores the intra-hypercolumnar mechanism 
by which their receptive fields are formed. Inputs to the model are images filtered 
by the edge- or bar-like local receptive fields (RFs) of V1 cells.  Cells influence each 
other contextually via horizontal intra-cortical connections (Rockland and Lund 
1983, Gilbert, 1992), transforming patterns of inputs to patterns of cell responses. 
Fig. I shows the elements of the model and their interactions. At each location 
i there is a model V1 hypercolumn composed of K neuron pairs. Each pair (i, 
has RF center i and preferred orientation  - k'/K for k -- 1,2, ...K, and is 
called (the neural representation of) an edge segment. Based on experimental data 
(White, 1989), each edge segment consists of an excitatory and an inhibitory neuron 
that are interconnected, and each model cell represents a collection of local cells of 
similar types. The excitatory cell receives the visual input; its output is used as 
a measure of the response or salience of the edge segment and projects to higher 
visual areas. The inhibitory cells are treated as interneurons. Based on observations

inputs modeling the general and local normalization of activities (see Li (1998) for 
more details). Visual input Iis persists after onset, and initializes the activity levels 
gz (xis). The activities are then modified by the contextual influences. Depending on 
the visual input, the system often settles into an oscillatory state (Gray and Singer, 
1989, see the details in Li 1998). Temporal averages of gz (xis) over several oscillation 
cycles are used as the model's output. The nature of the computation performed by 
the model is determined largely by the horizontal connections J and W, which are 
local (spanning only a few hypercolumns), and translation and rotation invariant 
(Fig. XB).

Figure 2: An example of the performance of the model. A: Input ]i consists of two 
regions; each visible bar has the same input strength. B: Model output for A, showing 
non-uniform output strengths (temporal averages of g(xi)) for the edges. The input and 
output strengths are proportional to the bar widths. Because of the noise in the system, 
the saliencies of the bars in the same column are not exactly the same, this is also the case 
in other figures. 
The model was applied to some texture border and figure-ground stimuli, as shown 
in examples in the figures. The input values ie are the same for all visible bars in 
each example. The differences in the outputs are caused by intracortical interac- 
tions. They become significant about one membrane time constant after the initial 
neural response (Li, 1998). The widths of the bars in the figures are proportional 
to input and output strengths. The plotted region in each picture is often a small 
region of an extended image. The same model parameters (e.g. the dependence 
of th synaptic weights on distances and orientations, the thresholds and gains in 
the functions g() and gy(), and the level of input noise in Io) are used for all the 
simulation examples. 
Fig. 2 demonstrates that the model indeed gives higher responses to the boundaries 
between texture regions. This border effect is highly significant within a distance of 
about 2 texture element spacings from the border. Thus the effective border region 
is about 2 in texture element spacings in this example. Furthermore, at about 9 
texture element spacings to the right of the texture border there is a much smaller 
but significant (visible on the figure) secondary peak in the response amplitude. 
Thus the ripple wavelength is about 9 texture element spacings here. The border 
effect is mainly caused by the fact that the texture elements at the border expe- 
rience less iso-orientation suppression (which reduces the response levels to other 
texture bars in the middle of a homogeneous (texture) region) -- the texture el- 
ements at the border have fewer neighboring texture bars of a similar orientation 
than the texture elements in the centers of the regions. The stronger responses to 
the effective border region cause extra iso-orientation suppression to texture bars 
near but right outside the effective border region. Let us call this region of stronger

suppression from the border the border suppression region, which is significant and 
visible in Fig. (2B). This region can reach no further than the longest length of 
the horizontal connenctions (mediating the suppresion) from the effective border 
region. Consequently, texture bars right outside the border suppression region not 
only escape the stronger suppression from the border, but also experience weaker 
iso-orientation suppression from the weakened texture bars in the nearby border 
suppression region. As a result, a second saliency peak appears -- the ripple effect, 
and we can hence conclude that the ripple wavelength is of the same order of mag- 
nitude as the longest connection length of the cortical lateral connections mediating 
intra-cortical interactions. 
Fig. 3 shows that for very small figures, the whole figure belongs to the effective 
border region and is highlighted in the V1 responses. As the figure size increases, the 
responses in the inside of the figure become smaller than the responses in the border 
region. However, when the size of the figure is appropriate, namely about twice the 
ripple wavelength, the center of the figure induces a secondary response highlight. In 
this case, the ripples or the secondary saliency peaks from both borders superpose 
onto each other at the same spatial location at the center of the figure. This 
reinforces the saliency peak at this medial axis since it has two border suppression 
regions (from two opposite borders), one on each side of it, as its contextual stimuli. 
For even larger figures, the medial axis effect diminishes because the ripples from

the two opposite borders of the figure no longer reinforce each other. 
Fig. 4 demonstrates that the border effect and its consequences for the medial axis 
also depend on the shape of the figures and the nature of the texture they contain 
(eg the orientations of the elements). Bars in the texture parallel to the border 
induce stronger highlights, and as a consequence, cause stronger ripple effects and 
medial axis highlights. This comes from the stronger co-linear, contour enhancing, 
inputs these bars receive than bars not parallel to the border.

3 Summary and Discussion 
The model of V1 was originally proposed to account for pre-attentive contour en- 
hancement and visual segmentation (Li 1998, 1999, 1999b). The contextual influ- 
ences mediated by intracortical interactions enable each V1 neuron to process inputs 
from a local image area substantially larger than its classical receptive field. This 
enables cortical neurons to detect image locations where translation invariance in 
the input image breaks down, and highlight these image locations with higher neu- 
ral activities, making them conspicuous. These highlights mark candidate locations 
for image region (or object surface) boundaries, smooth contours and small figures 
against backgrounds, serving the purpose of pre-attentive segmentation. 
This paper has shown that the figure-ground and medial axis effects observed in the 
recent experiments can be accounted for using a purely V1 mechanism for border 
highlighting, provided that the sizes of the figures are small enough or of finite and 
appropriate scale. This has been the case in the existing experiments. We therefore 
suggest that feedbacks from higher visual areas are not necessary to explain the 
experimental observations, although we cannot, of course, exclude the possibilities 
that they also contribute.
