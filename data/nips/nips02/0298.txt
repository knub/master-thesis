Abstract 
To achieve high-rate image data compression 
while maintainig a high quality reconstructed 
image, a good image model and an efficient 
way to represent the specific data of each 
image must be introduced. Based on the 
physiological knowledge of multi- channel 
characteristics and inhibitory interactions 
between them in the human visual system, 
a mathematically coherent parallel architecture 
for image data compression which utilizes the 
Markov random field image model and 
interactions between a vast number of filter 
banks, is proposed. 
1. Introduction 
Data compression has been one of the most important 
and active areas in information theory and computer science. 
The goal of image coding is reducing the number of bits 
in data representation as much as possible, and reconstructing 
a faithful duplicate of the original image. In order to achieve 
a high compression ratio while maintaining the high quality 
Model Based Image Compression 299 
of the reconstructed image, a good image model and an 
efficient way to represent image data must be found. Based 
on physiological knowledge of the human visual system, we 
propose a mathematically coherent parallel architecture for 
the image data compression, which utilizes a stochastic image 
model and interactions between a vast number of filter banks. 
2. Model based image compression and 
dynamic spatial filtering 
The process of reconstructing an original image from 
compressed data is an ill-posed problem, since an infinite 
number of original images lead to the same compressed data 
and solutions to the inverse problem can not uniquely be 
determined. The coupled Markov random field (MRF) image 
model proposed by Geman and Geman is introduced to resolve 
this ill-posedness. The mean field approximation of the MRF 
is equivalent to a recurrent type neural network with the 
Ljapunov function (see Koch. Marroquin and Yuille as a 
special case where the form of the Ljapunov function is 
predetermined). Correspondingly, a similar deterministic 
framework of image compression in which the MRF is 
replaced by the recurrent network, can be developed. 
Further, even if a good MRF model is introduced for 
a family of images, the data for each image must be known 
in order to reconstruct it. In previous studies of image data 
compression, representation of image data is fixed in each 
schema. On the other hand, in this paper, an adaptive data 
representation is proposed, tuned to each image by competion 
and cooperation of a vast number of filter banks. 
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the proposed 
communication system. Procedures at the encoder side are 
(1) partial partition and segmentation of the image by the 
300 Okamoto, Kawato, Inui and Miyake 
line process of the MRF which represents the image 
discontinuity, (2) learning of energy parameters which uses 
the line process to define the MRF model in each segmented 
area of the image, (3) adaptive data representation of images 
by cooperation and competition of a vast number of filter 
banks. (4) Information about energy value parameters, the 
types of selected filter and their outputs, and the line 
processes is transmitted, through communication channel. 
(5) Image reconstruction is carried out at the decorder site 
by stochastic relaxation based on the aquired MRF model, 
output from the selected filters, and the line process. These 
procedures are explained in detail below. 
1. The set of line processes represents discontinuities in 
the 3-dimensional world such as occluding contours or 
boundaries between different objects. It is not necessarily 
closed, but it can posess a strong tendency to do so if the 
MRF model is appropriately chosen. Based on this property, 
the image can be partially segmented into several regions. 
2. If we adopt the MRF image model, the occurrence 
probability II(w) of each configuration eo is Gibbsian: 
exp{-U(o2)/T} 
II(o)= Z 
Furthermore, the energy U(eo) can be expressed as a summation 
of local potential Vc(eo), which depends on the configuration 
only in the clique C. 
E Vc(o) 
CeS½ 
Determination of the local energy Vc is equivalent to defining 
a specific MRF model of the image. Determination of the 
local energy is equivalent to assigning a real value Vt, to 
Model Based Image Compression 301 
every possible configuration within the clique C. These energy 
parameters are estimated so that the Kullback divergence 
G between the real image distribution P and the model image 
distribution P' is minimized: 
. P(w) 
G(V)=P(to)log|,, 
The following learning equation can be derived in 
approximately the same way as the learning rule of the 
Boltzmann machine (Ackley, Hinton, Sejnowski, 1085). 
0G 
AVe,= -COVe, -r{< Y], I,(C)>-< F, I,(C)}>d,r 
Here I(C) is the characteristic function of the specific 
configuration : of the clique C, that is, I(C)=i if(y,;seC}=}: 
otherwise, I(C)=0. The first term on the right side is the 
average number of configurations in the real image. The 
second term on the right side is the average number of each 
configuration }: generated in the MRF with the energy Vc 
when part of the image configuration is fixed to the given 
image. 
3. This procedure is based on the multi-channel 
characteristics of the human visual system, inhibitory 
interaction between X-cell and Y-cell systems, and interactions 
between columns with different orientation selectivity, etc. 
We prepare a vast number of filters centered at each site 
s in a variety of sizes, shapes and orientations. In particular s 
we use two-dimensional Gaussian filters Gs(w) to represent 
the DC components (i.e. average luminance) of the gray 
level, and use the first-order derivative of the Gaussian filters 
VGs(w) to represent the gradient of the gray levels. The filters 
whose receptive fields significantly intersect with the line 
process are inhibited. Inhibitory interactions between filters 
of similar, shape and orientation at nearby sites are introduced 
302 Okamoto, Kawato, Inui and Miyake 
as well as self excitation to find the N-maximum outputs 
of VGs, and to find the N-minimum outputs of the Laplacian 
Gaussian AGs. Of course, 2N must be less than the number 
of sites to attain data compression. 
4. We transmit the local potential energy, the site of the 
line process, and the outputs from the N- maximum, and 
the outputs from the N Gaussain filters which correspond 
to the N- minimum Laplacian Gaussain filters. 
5. Image reconstruction is carried out by the usual 
stochastic relaxation, that is, energy minimization with 
simulated annealing. However, because we have data 
constraints as output from the 2N selected filters, we need 
to minimize the sum of the MRF model energy and the data 
constraint energy: 
N N 
E,(o) =U(o) +{ X (G-G(o))+ X (VG-VG(o)) } 
k=l k=l 
If we do not further compress the filter outputs, the 
regularization parameter is increased to infinity during 
constrained stochastic relaxation. 
3. Experimental results 
First, we ascertained that the proposed energy learning 
rule works well for various images. Here, we report only 
one example from the data compression experiments. We used 
the shown in Fig. 2a to examine the potential of our scheme. 
The image data consists of 256 pixels, each of which has 
8 bit gray levels. We used the dynamic spatial sampling 
of filter banks. Fig 2a also shows selected sample points 
in the image as black dots, as well as a few examples of 
selected filter shapes. Note that not only the density of 
the sampling points, but also the selected filter shapes are

appropriate local characteristics of the image. Fig. 2b shows 
the reconstructed image after 20 iterations of the relaxation 
computation. The signal to noise ratio of the reconstructed 
images was about 38dB.
