ABSTRACT 
We announce new CMOS synapse circuits using only three 
and four MOSFETs/synapse. Neural states are asynchronous 
pulse streams, upon which arithmetic is performed directly. 
Chips implementing over 100 fully programmable synapses 
are described and projections to networks of hundreds of 
neurons are made. 
1 OVERVIEW OF PULSE FIRING NEURAL VLSI 
The inspiration for the use of pulse firing in silicon neural networks is 
clearly the electrical/chemical pulse mechanism in "real" biological neurons. 
Asynchronous, digital voltage pulses are used to signal states { Si ) through 
synapse weights { Tii } to emulate neural dynamics. Neurons fire voltage 
pulses of a frequency' determined by their level of activity but of a constant 
magnitude (usually 5 Volts) [Murray,1989a]. As indicated in Fig. 1, 
synapses perform arithmetic directly on these asynchronous pulses, to 
increment or decrement the receiving neuron's activity. The activity of a 
receiving neuron i, xi is altered at a frequency controlled by the sending 
neuron j, with state S by an amount determined by the synapse weight 
(here, Ti ).

A silicon neural network based on this techniq. ue is therefore an 
asynchronous, analog computational structure. It is a hybrid between 
analog and digital techniques in that the individual neural pulses are digital 
voltage spikes, with all the robustness to noise and ease of regeneration that 
this implies. These and other characteristics of pulse stream networks will 
be discussed in detail later in this paper. Pulse stream methods, developed 
in Edinburgh, have since been investigated by other groups - see for 
instance [E1-Leithy, 1988, Daniell,1989]. 
1.1. WHY PULSE STREAMS? 
There are some advantages in the use of pulse streams, and pulse rate 
encoding, in implementing neural networks. It should be admitted here that 
the initial move towards pulse streams was motivated by the desire to 
implement pseudo-analog circuits on an essentially digital CMOS process. It 
was a decision based at the time on expediency rather than on great vision 
on our part, as we did not initially appreciate the full benefits of this form 
of pulse stream arithmetic [Murray,1987]. 
Pulse-Firing Neural Chips for Hundreds of Neurons 787 
For example, the voltages on the terminals of a MOSFET, Vcs and Vos 
could clearly be used to code a neural synapse weight and state respectively, 
doing away with the need for pulses. In the pulse stream form, however, 
we can arrange that only Vcs is an "unknown". The device equations are 
therefore easily simplified, and furthermore the body effect is more 
predictable. In an equivalent continuous - time circuit, Vos will also be a 
variable, which codes information. Predicting the transistor's operating 
regime becomes more difficult, and the equation cannot be simplified. 
Aside of the transistor - level advantages, giving rise to extremely compact 
synapse circuits, there may be architectural advantages. There are certainly 
architectural consequences. Digital pulses are easier to regenerate, easier to 
pass between chips, and generally far more noise - insensitive than analog 
voltages, all of which are significant advantages in the VLSI context. 
Furthermore, the relationship to the biological exemplar should not be 
ignored. It is at least interesting - whether it is significant remains to be 
seen. 
2 FULLY ANALOG PULSE STREAM SYNAPSES 
Our early pulse stream chips proved the viability of the pulse stream 
technique [Murray,1988a]. However, the area occupied by the digital 
weight storage memory was unacceptably large. Furthermore, the use of 
pseudo-clocks in an analog circuit was both aesthetically unsatisfactory and 
detrimental to smooth dynamical behaviour, and using separate signal paths 
for excitation and inhibition was both clumsy and inefficient. Accordingly, 
we have developed a family of fully programmable, fully analog synapses 
using dynamic weight storage, and operating on individual pulses to perform 
arithmetic. We have already reported time-modulation synapses based on 
this technique, and a later section of this paper will present the associated 
chips [Murray, 1988b, Murray,1989b]. 
2.1. TRANSCONDUCTANCE MULTIPLIER SYNAPSES 
The equation of interest is that for the drain-source current, Ios, for a 
MOSFET in the linear or triode region:- 
- Z' ( - vT ) Vos 2 
Here, Cox is the oxide capacitance/area, ix the carrier mobility, W the 
transistor gate width, L the transistor gate length, and Vas, Vr, Vos the 
transistor gate-source, threshold and drain-source voltages respectively. 
xCox W 
This expression for los contains a useful product term:- L x Vas x Vos. 
However, it also contains two other terms in Vs x Vr and Vos 2 
One approach might be to ignore this imperfection in the multiplication, in 
the hope that the neural parallelism renders it irrelevant. We have chosen, 
rather, to remove the unwanted terms via a second MOSFET, as shown in 
Fig. 2.

This is a fairly well-known circuit, and constitutes a Transconductance 
Multiplier. It was reported initially for use in signal processing chips such 
as filters [Denyet,1981, Han,1984]. It would be feasible to use it directly in 
a continuous time network, with analog voltages representing the { Si }. We 
choose to use it within a pulse-stream environment, to minimise the 
uncertainty in determining the operating regime, and terminal voltages, of 
the MOSFETs, as described above. 
Fig. 3 shows two related pulse stream synapse based on this technique. The 
presynaptic neural state S, is represented by a stream of 0-5V digital, 
asynchronous voltage pulses'Vj. These are used to switch a current sink and 
source in and out of the synapse, either pouring current to a fixed voltage 
node (excitation of the postsynaptic neuron), or removing it (inhibition). 
The magnitude and direction of the resultant current pulses are determined 
by the synapse weight, currently stored as a dynamic, analog voltage Tij.

Figure 3: Use of a transconductance multiplier to 
form fully programmable pulse-stream synapses. 
The fixed voltage V,, and the summation of the current pulses to give an 
activity xi = TijSj are both provided by an Operational Amplifier 
integrator circuit, whose saturation characteristics incidentally apply a 
sigmoid nonlinearity. The transistors T1 and T4 act as power supply 
"on/off" switches in Fig. 3a, and in Fig 3b are replaced by a single 
transistor, in the output "leg" of the synapse, Transistors T2 and T3 form the 
transconductance multiplier. One of the transistors has the synapse voltage 
Ti/ on its gate, the other a reference voltage, whose value determines the 
crossover point between excitation and inhibition. The gate-source voltages 
on T2 and T3 need to be substantially greater than the drain-source 
voltages, to maintain linear operation. This is not a difficult constraint to 
satisfy. 
The attractions of these cells are that all the transistors are n-type, removing 
the need for area-hungry isolation well structures, and In Fig. 3a, the 
vertical line of drain-source connections is topologically attractive, 
producing very compact layout, while Fig. 3b has fewer devices. It is not 
yet clear which will prove optimal. 
2.2. ASYNCHRONOUS "SWITCHED CAPACITOR" SYNAPSE 
Fig. 4 shows a further variant, in the form of a "switched capacitor" pulse 
stream synapse. Here the synapse voltage T u is electrically buffered to 
switched capacitor structure, clocked by the presynaptic neural pulse 
waveforms. Packets of charge are therefore "metered out" to the current 
integrator whose magnitude is controlled by Ti (positive or negative), and 
790 Brownlow Tarassenko Murray Hamilton, ttan and Reekie 
whose frequency by the presynaptic pulse rate. The overall principle is 
therefore the same as that described for the transconductance multiplier 
synapses, although the circuit level details are different.

Conventional synchronous switched capacitor techniques have been used in 
neural integration [Tsividis,1987], but nowhere as directly as in this 
example. 
2.3. CHIP DETAILS AND RESULTS 
Both the time-modulation and switched capacitor synapses have been tested 
fully in silicon, and Fig. 5 shows a section of the time-modulation test chip. 
This synapse currently occupies 174x731xm.

Three distinct pulse-stream synapse types have been presented, with 
different operating schemes and characteristics. None has yet been used to 
configure a large network, but this is now being done. Current estimates 
for the number of synapses implementable using the two techniques 
described above are as shown in Table 1, using an 8mmx8mm die as an 
example. 
The lack of direct scaling between transistor count and synapse count (e..g. 
why does the factor 4/11 not manifest itself as a much larger increase In 
synapse count) can be explained. The raw number of transistors is not the 
only factor in determining circuit area. Routing of power supplies, synapse 
weight address lines, as well as storage capacitor size all take their toll, and 
are common to both of the above synapse circuits. Furthermore, in analog 
circuitry, transistors are almost certainly larger than minimum geometry, 
and generally significantly larger, to minimise noise problems. This all gives 
rise to a larger area than might be expected from simple arguments. 
Clearly, however, we are in position to implement serious sized networks, 
firstly with the time-modulation synapse, which is fully tested in silicon, and 
later with the transconductance type, which is still under detailed design and 
layout.

In addition, we are developing new oscillator forms, techniques to 
counteract leakage from dynamic nodes, novel inter-chip signalling strategies 
specifically for pulse-stream systems, and non-volatile (ot-Si) pulse stream 
synapses. These are to be used for applications in text-speech synthesis, 
pattern analysis and robotics. Details will be published as the work 
progresses.
