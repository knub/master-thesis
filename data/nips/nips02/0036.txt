ABSTRACT 
Traditional inethods of studying neural coding characterize the cn- 
coding of known stimuli in average neural responses. Organisms 
face nearly the opposite task -- decoding short segments of a spike 
train to extract information about an unknown, time-varying stim- 
ulus. Here we present strategies for characterizing the neural code 
from the point of view of the organism, culminating in algorithms 
for real-time stimulus reconstruction based on a single sample of 
the spike train. These methods are applied to the design and anal- 
ysis of experiments on an identified movement-sensitive neuron in 
the fly visual system. As far as we know this is the first instance in 
which a direct "reading" of the neural code has been accomplished. 
1 Introduction 
Sensory systems receive information at extremely high rates, and much of this infor- 
mation must be processed in real time. To understand real-time signal processing 
in biological systems we must understand the representation of this information in 
neural spike trains. We ask several questions in particular: 
Does a single neuron signal only the occurrence of particular stimulus "fea- 
tures," or can the spike train represent a continuous time-varying input?

How much information is carried by the spike train of a single neuron? 
Is the reliability of the encoded signal limited by noise at the sensory input 
or by noise and inefficiencies in the subsequent layers of neural processing? 
Is the neural code robust to errors in spike timing, or do realistic levels of 
synaptic noise place significant limits on information transmission? 
Do simple analog computations on the encoded signals correspond to simple 
manipulations of the spike trains? 
Although neural coding has been studied for more than fifty years, clear experimen- 
tal answers to these questions have been elusive (Perkel & Bullock, 1968; de Ruyter 
van Steveninck & Bialek, 1988). Here we present a new approach to the characteri- 
zation of the neural code which provides explicit and sometimes surprising answers 
to these questions when applied to an identified movement-sensitive neuron in the 
fly visual system. 
We approach the study of spiking neurons from the point of view of the organism, 
which, based only on the spike train, must estimate properties of an unknown time- 
varying stimulus. Specifically we try to solve the problem of decoding the spike train 
to recover the stimulus in real time. As far as we know our work is the first instance 
in which it has been possible to "read" the neural code in this literal sense. Once 
we can read the code, we can address the questions posed above. In this paper we 
focus on the code reading algorithm, briefly summarizing the results which follow. 
2 Theoretical background 
The traditional approach to the study of neural coding characterizes the encoding 
process: For an arbitrary stimulus waveform s(r), what can we predict about the 
spike train? This process is completely specified by the conditional probability 
distribution P[{t,}ls(r)] of the spike arrival times {ti} conditional on the stimulus 
s(r). In practice one cannot characterize this distribution in its entirety; most 
experiments result in only the lowest moment -- the firing rate as function of time 
given the stimulus. 
The classic experiments of Adrian and others established that, for static stimuli, the 
resulting constant firing rate provides a measure of stimulus strength. This concept 
is easily extended to any stimulus waveform which is characterized by constant 
parameters, such as a single frequency or fixed amplitude sine wave. Much of the 
effort in studying the encoding of sensory signals in the nervous system thus reduces 
to probing the relation between these stimulus parameters and the resulting firing 
rate. Generalizations to time-varying firing rates, especially in response to periodic 
signals, have also been explored. 
The firing rate is a continuous function of time which measures the probability 
per unit time that the cell will generate a spike. The rate is thus by definition 
an average quantity; it is not a property of a single spike train. The rate can 
be estimated, in principle, by averaging over a large ensemble of redundant cells, 
38 Bialek, Rieke, van Steveninck and Warland 
or by averaging responses of a single cell over repeated presentations of the same 
stimulus. This latter approach dominates the experimental study of spiking neurons. 
Measurements of firing rate rely on some form of redundancy -- either the spatial 
redundancy of identical cells or the temporal redundancy of repeated stimuli. It is 
simply not clear that such redundancy exists in real sensory systems under natural 
stimulus conditions. In the absence of redundancy a characterization of neural 
responses in terms of firing rate is of little relevance to the signal processing problems 
faced by the organism. To say that "information is coded in firing rates" is of no 
use unless one can explain how the organism could estimate these firing rates by 
observing the spike trains of its own neurons. 
We believe that none of the existing approaches 2 to neural coding addresses the basic 
problem of reaLtime signal processing with neural spike trains: The organism must 
extract information about continuously varying stimulus waveforms using only the 
discrete sequences of spikes. Real-time signal processing with neural spike trains 
thus involves some sort of interpolation between the spikes that allows the organism 
to estimate a continuous function of time. 
The most basic problem of real-time signal processing is to decode the spike train and 
recover an estimate of the stimulus waveform itself. Clearly if we can accomplish 
this task then we can begin to understand how spike trains can be manipulated to 
perform more complex computations; we can also address the quantitative issues 
outlined in the Introduction. Because of the need to interpolate between spikes, 
such decoding is not a simple matter of inverting the conventional stimulus-response 
(rate) relations. In fact it is not obvious a priori that true decoding is even possible. 
One approach to the decoding problem is to construct models of the encoding 
process, and proceed analytically to develop algorithms for decoding within the 
context of the model (Bialek & Zee, 1990). Using the results of this approach we 
can predict that linear filtering will, under some conditions, be an effective decoding 
algorithm, and we can determine the form of the filter itself. In this paper we have 
a more limited goal, namely to see if the class of decoding algorithms identified 
by Bialek and Zee is applicable to a real neuron. To this end we will treat the 
structure of the decoding filter as unknown, and find the "best" filter under given 
experimental conditions. 
We imagine building a set of (generally non-linear) filters {F,} which operate on 
the spike train to produce an estimate of the stimulus. If the spikes arrive at times 
{ti}, we write our estimate of the signal as a generalized convolution,

2Higher moments of the conditional probability P[{t i}ls(r)], such as the inter-spike interval 
distribution (Perkel & Bullock, 1968) are also average properties, not properties of single spike 
trains, and hence may not be relevant to real-time signal processing. White-noise methods (Mar- 
marelis & Marmarelis, 1978) result in models which predict the time-varying firing rate in response 
to arbitrary input waveforms and thus suffer the same limitations as other rate-based approaches.

How good are the reconstructions? We separate systematic and random errors by 
introducing a frequency dependent gain g(a) such that /Ig(a)l) = g(a)/Igeo,(a)l ). 
The rcsulting gain is approximately unity through a reasonable bandwidth. Further, 
the distribution of deviations between the stimulus and reconstruction is approx- 
imately Gaussian. The absence of systematic errors suggests that non-linearities 
in the reconstruction filter are unlikely to help. Indeed, the contribution from the 
st ond order term in Eq. (1) to the reconstructions is negligible.

Figure 2: Spectral density of displacement noise from our reconstruction (upper 
curve). By multiplying the displacement noise level by a bandwidth, we obtain the 
square of the angular resolution of H1 for a step displacement. For a reasonable 
bandwidth the resolution is much less than the photoreceptor spacing, 1.35 o -- 
"hyperacuity." Also shown is the limit to the resolution of small displacements set 
by noise in the photoreceptor array (lower curve). 
We identify the noise at frequency w as the difference between the stimulus and 
the normalized reconstruction, fi(a) - (a)- g(co)e,t(CO). We then compute the 
pectral density (noise power per unit bandwidth) of the displacement noise (Fig 2). 
The noise level achieved in H 1 is astonishing; with a one second integration time an 
observer of the spike train in H1 could judge the amplitude of a low frequency dither 
to 0.01 ø -- more than one hundred times less than the photoreceptor spacing! If the

2. Minimize X 2 with respect to purely causal functions. This may be done an- 
alytically, or numerically by expanding Fl(r) in a complete set of functions 
which vanish at negative times, then minimizing X 2 by varying the coefficients 
of the expansion. In this method we must explicitly introduce a delay time 
which measures the lag between the true stimulus and our reconstruction. 
We use the filter generated from the first method (which is the best possible linear 
filter) to check the filter generated by the second method. Fig. 1 illustrates recon- 
structions using these two methods. The filters themselves are also shown in the 
figure; we see that both methods give essentially the same answer.

We define the optimal filter to be that which minimizes X 2 = f dt[s(t) - sest(t)l 2, 
where s(t) is the true stimulus, and the integration is over the duration of the 
experiment. 
To insure that the filters we calculate allow real-time decoding, we require that the 
filters be causal, for example Fi(r < 0) = 0. But the occurrence of a spike at 
t' conveys information about the stimulus at a time t < t', so we must delay our 
estimate of the stimulus by some time raetay > t' - t. In general we gain more 
information by increasing the delay, so we face a tradeoff: Longer waiting times 
allow us to gain more information but introduce longer reaction times to important 
stimuli. This tradeoff is exactly the tradeoff faced by the organism in reacting to 
external stimuli based on noisy and incomplete information. 
3 Movement detection in the blowfly visual system 
We apply our methods in experiments on a single wide field, movement-sensitive 
neuron (Hi) in the visual system of the blowfly Calliphora erylhrocephela. Flies 
and other insects exhibit visually guided flight; during chasing behavior course 
corrections can occur on time scales as short as 30 msec (Land & Colleft, 1974). H1 
appears to be an obligatory link in this control loop, encoding wide field horizontal 
movements (Hausen, 1984). Given that the maximum firing rate in H1 is 100- 
200 Hz, behavioral decisions must be based on the information carried by just a few 
spikes from this neuron. Further, the horizontal motion detection system consists 
of only a handful of neurons, so the fly has no opportunity to compute average 
responses (or firing rates). 
In the experiments described here, the fly is looking at a rigidly moving random pat- 
tern (de Ruyter van Steveninck, 1986). The pattern is presented on an oscilloscope, 
and moved horizontally every 500 ysec in discrete steps chosen from an ensemble 
which approximates Gaussian white noise. This time scale is short enough that we 
can consider the resulting stimulus waveform s(t) to be the instantaneous angular 
velocity. We record the spike arrival times {tl} extracellularly from the H1 neuron. 3 
4 First order reconstructions 
To reconstruct the stimulus waveform requires that we find the filter F1 which 
minimizes X 2. We do this in two different ways: 
1. Disregard the constraint that the filter be causal. In this case we can write 
an explicit formula for the optimal filter in terms of the spike trains and the 
aThere is one further caveat to the experiment. The firing rate in HI is increased for back-to- 
fi'ont motion and is decreased for h'ont-to-back motion; the dynamic range is much greater in the 
excitatory direction. The fly, however, achieves high sensitivity in both directions by combining 
information from both eyes. Because front-to-back motion in one eye corresponds to back-to-front 
motion in the other eye, we can simulate the two eye case while recording fi'om only one H1 cell 
by using an antisymmetric stimulus waveform. We combine the information coded in the spike 
trains corresponding to the two "polarities" of the stimulus to obtain the information available 
from both H1 neurons. 
42 Bialek, Rieke, van $teveninck and Warland 
are set by noise in the photoreceptor array. We have calculated these limits in the 
case where the displacements are small, which is true in our experiments at high 
frequencies. In comparing these limits with the results in H1 it is crucial that the 
photoreceptor signal and noise characteristics (de Ruyter van Steveninck, 1986) are 
measured under the same conditions as the H1 experiments analyzed here. It is 
clear from Fig. 2 that H1 approaches the theoretical limit to its performance. We 
emphasize that the noise spectrum in Fig. 2 is not a hypothetical measure of neural 
performance. Rather it is the real noise level achieved in our reconstructions. As 
far as we know this is the first instance in which the equivalent spectral noise level 
of a spiking neuron has been measured. 
To explore the tradeoff between the quality and delay of the reconstruction we 
measure the cross-correlation of the smoothed stimulus with the reconstructions 
calculated using method 2 above for delays of 10-70 msec. For a delay of 10 msec 
the reconstruction carries essentially no information; this is expected since a de- 
lay of 10 msec is close to the intrinsic delay for phototransduction. As the delay 
is increased the reconstructions improve, and this improvement saturates for de- 
lays greater than 40 msec, close to the behavioral reaction time of 30 msec -- the 
structure of the code is well matched to the behavioral decision task facing the 
organism. 
5 Conclusions 
Learning how to read the neural code has allowed us to quantify the information 
carried in the spike train independent of assumptions regarding the structure of 
the code. In addition, our analysis gives some hopefully more general insights into 
neural coding and computation: 
1. The continuously varying movement signal encoded in the firing of H1 can be re- 
constructed by an astonishingly simple linear filter. If neurons summed their inputs 
and marked the crossing of thresholds (as in many popular models), such recon- 
structions would be impossible; the threshold crossings are massively ambiguous 
indicators of the signal waveform. We have carried out similar studies on a stan- 
dard model neuron (the FitzHugh-Nagumo model), and find results similar to those 
in the H1 experiments. From the model neuron studies it appears that the linear 
representation of signals in spike trains is a general property of neurons, at least in 
a limited regime of their dynamics. In the near future we hope to investigate this 
statement in other sensory systems. 
. The reconstruction is dominated by a "window" of ~ dO msec during which 
at most a few spikes are fired. Because so few spikes are important, it does not 
make sense to talk about the "firing rate" -- estimating the rate rs. time from 
observations of the spike train is at least as hard as estimating the stimulus itself! 
3. The quality of the reconstructions can be improved by accepting longer delays, but 
this improvement saturates at ,.. 30 - 0 msec, in good agreement with behavioral 
decision times.

. Having decoded the neural signal we obtain a meaningful estimate of the noise 
level in the system and the information content of the code. H1 accomplishes a real- 
time version of hyperacuity, corresponding to a noise level near the limits imposed 
by the quality of the sensory input. It appears that this system is close to achieving 
optimal real-time signal processing. 
5. From measurements of the fault tolerance of the code we can place requirements 
on the noise levels in neural circuits using the information coded in H1. One of the 
standard objections to discussions of "spike timing" as a mechanism of coding is 
that there are no biologically plausible mechanisms which can make precise mea- 
surements of spike arrival times. We have tested the required timing precision by 
introducing timing errors into the spike train and characterizing the resulting recon- 
structions. Remarkably the code is 'ffault tolerant," the reconstructions degrading 
only slightly when we add timing errors of several msec. 
Finally, we wish to emphasize our own surprise that it is so simple to recover time 
dependent signals from neural spike trains. The filters we have constructed are not 
very complicated, and they are linear. These results suggest that the representation 
of time-dependent sensory data in the nervous system is much simpler than we might 
have expected. We suggest that, correspondingly, simpler models of sensory signal 
processing may be appropriate.
