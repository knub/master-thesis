Abstract 
Symmetrically connected recurrent networks have recently been 
used as models of a host of neural computations. However, be- 
cause of the separation between excitation and inhibition, biolog- 
ical neural networks are asymmetrical. We study characteristic 
differences between asymmetrical networks and their symmetri- 
cal counterparts, showing that they have dramatically different 
dynamical behavior and also how the differences can be exploited 
for computational ends. We illustrate our results in the case of a 
network that is a selective amplifier. 
1 Introduction 
A large class of non-linear recurrent networks, including those studied by 
Grossberg, 9 the Hopfield net, ø, and many more recent proposals for the 
head direction system, 27 orientation tuning in primary visual cortex, 25, , 3, 8 eye 
position, 2ø and spatial location in the hippocampus t9 make a key simplifying 
assumption that the connections between the neurons are symmetric. Analysis 
is relatively straightforward in this case, since there is a Lyapunov (or energy) 
function 4'  that often guarantees the convergence of the motion trajectory to an 
equilibrium point. However, the assumption of symmetry is broadly false. Net- 
works in the brain are almost never symmetrical, if for no other reason than the 
separation between excitation and inhibition. In fact, the question of whether ig- 
noring the polarity of the cells is simplification or over-simplication has yet to be 
fully answered. 
Networks with excitatory and inhibitory cells (El systems, for short) have 
long been studied, 6 for instance from the perspective of pattern generation in 
invertebrates, 23 and oscillations in the thalamus 7, 24 and the olfactory system. 7, 3 
Further, since the discovery of 40 Hz oscillations or synchronization amongst cells 
in primary visual cortex of anesthetised cat, 8, 5 oscillatory models of V1 involving 
separate excitatory and inhibitory cells have also been popular, mainly from the 
perspective of how the oscillations can be created and sustained and how they can

be used for feature linking or binding?' 22, 12 However the scope for computing 
with dynamically stable behaviors such as limit cycles is not yet clear. 
In this paper, we study the computational differences between a family of EI sys- 
tems and their symmetric counterparts (which we call S systems). One inspira- 
tion for this work is Li's nonlinear EI system modeling how the primary visual 
cortex performs contour enhancement and pre-attentive region segmentation. x4, x 5 
Studies by Braun 2 had suggested that an S system model of the cortex can not 
perform contour enhancement unless additional (and biologically questionable) 
mechanisms are used. This posed a question about the true differences between 
El and S systems that we answer. We show that EI systems can take advantage of 
dynamically stable modes that are not available to S systems. The computational 
significance of this result is discussed and demonstrated in the context of models 
of orientation selectivity. More details of this work, especially its significance for 
models of the primary visual cortical system, can be found in Li & Dayan (1999)? 
2 Theory and Experiment 
Consider a simple, but biologically significant, EI system in which excitatory and 
inhibitory cells come in pairs and there are no 'long-range' connections from the 
inhibitory cells 4, 5 (to which the Lyapunov theory la' 2x does not yet apply): 
2i -- --Xi q- Ej Jijg(xj) - h(yi) + Ii Tyi -- --Yi q- -j Wijg(xj) , (1) 
where xi are the principal excitatory cells, which receive external or sensory in- 
put Ii, and generate the network outputs g(xi); Yi are the inhibitory interneurons 
(which are taken here as having no external input); function g(x) = [x - T]+ is 
the threshold non-linear activation function for the excitatory cells; h(y) is the ac- 
tivation function for the inhibitory cells (for analytical convenience, we use the 
linear form h(y) = (y - Ty) although the results are similar with the non-linear 
h(y) = [y - Ty]+); 'ry is a time-constant for the inhibitory cells; and Jij and Wij are 
the output connections of the excitatory cells. Excitatory and inhibitory cells can 
also be perturbed by Gaussian noise. 
In the limit that the inhibitory cells are made infinitely fast (% - 0), we have 
yi: -j Wijg(xj), leaving the excitatory cells to interact directly with each other: 
i -- --Xi q- Ej Zijg(xj) - h(-j Wijg(xj)) q- Ii (2) 
= --xi + -j(Jij - Wij)g(xj) + Ii q- ti (3) 
where i are constants. In this network, the neural connections Zij - Wij between 
any two cells x can be either excitatory or inhibitory, as in many abstract neural 
network models. When Jij = Jji and Wij = Wji, the network has symmetric 
connections. This paper compares EI systems with such connections and the cor- 
responding S systems. Since there are many ways of setting Zij and Wij in the EI 
system whilst keeping constant Jij - Wij, which is the effective weight in the S 
system, one may intuitively expect the EI system to have a broader computational 
range. 
The response of either system to given inputs is governed by the location and lin- 
ear stability of their fixed points. The S network is so defined as to have fixed 
points  (where/c = 0 in equation 3) that are the same as those (, ) of the EI 
network. In particular,  depends on inputs I (the input-output sensitivity) via 
a = (lI - JD 9 + WDg) -1 dI, where lI is the identity matrix, J and W are the 
connection matrices, and D is a diagonal matrix with elements [Dg]ii -- 
However, although the locations of the fixed points are the same for the EI and S 
276 Z. Li and P. Dayan 
systems, the dynamical behavior of the systems about those fixed points are quite 
different, and this is what leads to their differing computational power. 
To analyse the stability of the fixed points, consider, for simplicity the case that % = 
I in the EI system, and that the matrices JD 9 and WD9 commute with eigenvalues 
,k and ,k TM respectively for k = 1,... , N where N is the dimension of x. The local 
deviations near the fixed points along each of the N modes will grow in time if the 
real parts of the following values are positive 
,),ffr = -1 + (1/2,k 4- (¬ (,k) 2 - ,w)/2 for the EI system 
%s = -1 - ,w + ,k for the S system 
In the case that ,k; and ,k TM are real, then if the S system is unstable, then the E1 
system is also unstable. For if -1 + ,kf - ,k TM > 0 then (,kf) 2 -4,k TM > (,kf - 2) 2, and 
so 27' = -2 + ,kf + ((,k/) 2 - 4,k TM) 1/2 > 0. However, if the EI system is oscillatory, 
4,kw > (,¾)2, then the S system is stable since -1 + ,¾ - ,k TM < -1 + ,¾ - (,¾)2/4 = 
-(1 - ,¾/2) 2 _< 0. Hence the E1 system can be unstable and oscillatory while the S 
system is stable. 
We are interested in the capacity of both systems to be selective amplifiers. This 
means that there is a class of inputs I that should be comparatively boosted by 
the system; whereas others should be comparatively suppressed. For instance, if 
the cells represent the orientation of a bar at a point, then the mode containing a 
unimodal, well-tuned, 'bump' in orientation space should be enhanced compared 
with poorly tuned inputs. 2s,, 8 However, if the cells represent oriented small 
bars at multiple points in visual space, then isolated smooth and straight contours 
should be enhanced compared with extended homogeneous textures j4,  s 
The quality of the systems will be judged according to how much selective ampli- 
fication they can stably deliver. The critical trade-off is that the more the selected 
mode is amplified, the more likely it is that, when the input is non-specific, the 
system will be unstable to fluctuations in the direction of the selected mode, and 
therefore will hallucinate spurious answers. 
3 The Two Point System 
A particularly simple case to consider has just two neurons (for the S system; two 
pairs of neurons for the E1 system) and weights 
/ / 
j j0 w w0 
The idea is that each node coarsely models a group of neurons, and the interac- 
tions between neurons within a group (jo and Wo) are qualitatively different from 
interactions between neurons between groups (j and w). The form of selective am- 
plification here is that symmetric or ambiguous inputs I a = 1(1, 1) should be sup- 
pressed compared with asynmetric inputs I b = 1(1, 0) (and, equivalently, I(0, 1)). 
In particular, given, I a, the system should not spontaneously generate a response 
with x significantly different from x2. Define the fixed points to be .e = .e > T 
under I" and .e > T ) .e2 under I b, where T is the threshold of the excitatory 
neurons. These relationships will be true across a wide range of input levels I. The 
ratio

R = d.e/dI = 1 + (Wo - jo) 1 + (Wo - jo) 
of the average relative responses as the input level I changes is a measure of how 
the system selectively amplifies the preferred or consistent inputs against ambigu- 
ous ones. This measure is appropriate only when the fluctuations of the system

from the fixed points .a and .e b are well behaved. We will show that this require- 
ment permits larger values of/t in the E1 system than the S system, suggesting that 
the EI system can be a more powerful selective amplifier. 
In the S system, the stabilities are governed by ?$ -- -(1 + Wo - jo) for the single 
mode of deviation z - . around fixed point b and ?s = -(1 + (Wo +w) - (jo + J)) 
for the two modes of deviation z+ -- (z - .) + (z2 - .) around fixed point 
a. Since we only consider cases when the input-output relationship ct/dI of the 
fixed points is well defined, this means 7 s < 0 and ,+s < 0. However, for some 
interaction parameters, there are two extra (uneven) fixed points . y6 . for (the 
even) input I a. Dynamic systems theory dictates these two uneven fixed points 
will be stable and that they will appear when the '-' mode of the perturbation 
around the even fixed point . = . is unstable. The system breaks symmetry 
in inputs, ie the motion trajectory diverges from the (unstable) even fixed point to 
one of the (stable) uneven ones. To avoid such cases, it is necessary that 7 s < 0. 
Combining this condition with equation 4 and 7 s < 0 leads to a upper bound on 
the amplification ratio R s < 2. Figure 1 shows phase portraits and the equilibrium 
points of the S system under input I a and I b for the two different system parameter 
regions. 
As we have described, the EI system has exactly the same fixed points as the S sys- 
tem, but they are more unstable. The stability around the symmetric fixed point 
under I a is governed by 7 I = - 1 +(jo+j)/2+ v/(Jo + j)2/4 - (Wo q- w), while that 
of the asymmetric fixed point under I b or I  by 7 EI = -l+jo/2+ v/jo2/4 - Wo. Con- 
sequently, when there are three fixed points under 1% all of them can be unstable 
in the EI system, and the motion trajectory cannot converge to any of them. In this 
case, when both the '+' and '-' modes around the symmetric fixed point . = 
are unstable, the global dynamics constrains the motion trajectory to a limit cycle 
around the fixed points. If z  z on this limit cycle, then the EI system will 
not break symmetry, even though the selective amplification ratio R > 2. Figure 2 
demonstrates the performance of the EI system in this regime. Figure 2A;B show 
various aspects of the response to input I  which should be comparatively sup- 
pressed. The system oscillates in such a way that z and z2 tend to be extremely 
similar (including being synchronised). Figure 2C;D show the same aspects of 
the response to I , which should be amplified. Again the network oscillates, and, 
although 9(z2) is not driven completely to 0 (it peaks at 15), it is very strongly 
dominated by g(z), and further, the overall response is much stronger than in 
figure 2A;B. 
The pertinent difference between the EI and S systems is that while the S system 
(when h(t) is linear) can only roll down the energy landscape to a stable fixed

point and break the input symmetry, the EI system can resort to global limit cycles 
z (t)  z2 (t) between unstable fixed points and maintain input symmetry. This is 
often (robustly over a large range of parameters) the case even when the '-' mode 
is locally more unstable (at the symmetric fixed point) than the '+' mode, because 
the '-' mode is much strongly suppressed when the motion trajectory enters the 
subthreshold region z < 7' and z2 < 7'. As we can see in figure 2A;B, this acts 
to suppress any overall growth in the '-' mode. Since the asymmetric fixed point 
under I b is just as unstable as that under I a, the E1 system responds to asynmetric 
input I b also by a stable limit cycle around the asymmetric fixed point. 
Since the response of the system in response to either pattern is oscillatory, there are 
various reasonable ways of evaluating the relative response ratio. Using the mean 
responses of the system during a cycle to define , the selective amplification ratio 
in figure 2 is/t EI = 97, which is significantly higher than the/t s = 2 available from 
the S system. This is a simple existence proof of the superiority of the E1 system for 
amplification, albeit at the expense of oscillations. In fact, in this two point case, it 
can be shown that any meaningful behavior of the S system (including symmetry 
breaking) can be qualitatively replicated in the EI system, but not vice-versa. 
4 The Orientation System 
Symmetric recurrent networks have recently been investigated in great depth for 
representing and calculating a wide variety of quantities, including orientation 
tuning. The idea behind the recurrent networks is that they should take noisy (and 
perhaps weakly tuned) input and selectively amplify the component that repre- 
sents an orientation 0 in the input, leaving a tuned pattern of excitation across the 
population that faithfully represents the underlying input. Based on the analysis 
above, we can expect that if an S network amplifies a tuned input enough, then it 
will break input syrmetry given an untuned input and thus hallucinate a tuned 
response. However, an EI system, in the same oscillatory regime as for the two 
point system, can maintain untuned and suppressed response to untuned inputs. 
We designed a particular EI system with a high selective amplification factor 
for tuned inputs I(0). In this case, units zi, yi have preferred orientations Oi = 
(i - N/2)r/N for i = 1... n. the connection matrices J is T6plitz with Gaussian 
tuning, and, for simplicity, [W]q does not depend on i,j. Figure 3B (and inset) 
shows the output of two units in the network in response to a tuned input, show- 
ing the nature of the oscillations and the way that selectivity builds up over the 
course of each period. Figure 3C shows the activities of all the units at three partic- 
ular phases of the oscillation. Figure 3A shows how the mean activity of the most

activated unit scales with the levels of tuned and untuned input. The network 
amplifies the tuned inputs dramatically more - note the logarithmic scale. The S 
system breaks syrmetry to the untuned input (b = 0) for these weights. If the 
weights are scaled tmiformly by a factor of 0.22, then the S system is appropriately 
stable. However, the magnification ratio is 4.2 rather than something greater than 
1000 in the EI system. 
The orientation system can be understood to a large qualitative degree by looking 
at its two-point cousins. Many of the essential constraints on the system are de- 
termined by the behavior of the system when the mode with zi = z 5 dominates, 
in which case the complex non-linearities induced by orientation tuning or cut off 
and its equivalents are irrelevant. Let J(f) and 1,7V(f) for (angular) frequency f 
be the Fourier transforms of J(i - j) =- [J]ij and W(i - j) -- [W]q and define 
,(f) = Re{-1 + J(f)/2 + iv/(ITV(f ) - 2(f)/4)}. Then, let f* >0 be the frequency 
such that ,(f*) > ,(f) for all f > 0. This is the non-translation-invariant mode 
that is most likely to cause instabilities for translation invariant behavior. A two 
point system that closely corresponds to the full system can be found by solving 
the simultaneous equations: 
jo + j = ff(O) Wo + W = ITV(O) jo - J = (f*) Wo - W = ITV(f*) 
This design equates the xx = x2 mode in the two point system with the f = 0 mode 
in the orientation system and the xl = -x2 mode with the f = f* mode. For smooth 
J and W, f* is often the smallest or one of the smallest non-zero spatial frequen- 
cies. It is easy to see that the two systems are exactly equivalent in the translation 
invariant mode xi = x under translation invariant input Ii - Ij in both the lin- 
ear and nonlinear regimes. The close correspondence between the two systems in 
other dynamic regimes is supported by simulation results. 16 Quantitatively, how- 
ever, the amplification ratio differs between the two systems. 
5 Conclusions 
We have studied the dynamical behavior of networks with syrmetrical and asym- 
metrical connections and have shown that the extra degrees of dynamical freedom 
280 Z. Li and P. Dayan 
of the latter can be put to good computational use, eg global dynamic stability via 
local instability. Many applications of recurrent networks involve selective am- 
plification - and the selective amplification factors for asyrmnetrical networks can 
greatly exceed those of symmetrical networks. We showed this in the case of orien- 
tation selectivity. However, it was originally inspired by a similar result in contour 
enhancement and texture segregation for which the activity of isolated oriented 
line elements should be enhanced if they form part of a smooth contour in the 
input and suppressed if they form part of an extended homogeneous texture. Fur- 
ther, the output should be homogeneous if the input is homogeneous (in the same 
way that the orientation network should not hallucinate orientations from untuned 
input). In this case, similar analysis 6 shows that stable contour enhancement is 
limited to just a factor of 3.0 for the S system (but not for the EI system), suggest- 
ing an explanation for the poor performance of a slew of S systems in the literature 
designed for this purpose. We used a very simple system with just two pairs of 
neurons to develop analytical intuitions which are powerful enough to guide our 
design of the more complex systems. We expect that the details of our model, with 
the exact pairing of excitatory and inhibitory cells and the threshold non-linearity, 
are not crucial for the results. 
Inhibition in the cortex is, of course, substantially more complicated than we have 
suggested. In particular, inhibitory cells do have somewhat faster (though finite) 
time constants than excitatory cells, and are also not so subject to short term plas- 
ticity effects such as spike rate adaptation. Nevertheless, oscillations of various 
sorts can certainly occur, suggesting the relevance of the computational regime 
that we have studied.
